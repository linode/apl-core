# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We only want to support forward fixing of our code, so please always upgrade when new releases are published.
A lot of vulnerabilities are automatically closed when we upgrade the open source solutions in our code base.
We only make explicit mention of vulnerabilities mentioned to us and or fixed by us to allow for tracking.
Read the changelog to see what security related issues have been solved, if any.
