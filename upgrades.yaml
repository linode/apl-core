# Upgrade commands between versions are configured in this file, and executed in bash (FROM ubuntu:20.04)
# Options:
# - blockingOperations: will break on exit code <> 0
# - nonBlockingOperations: do not care about exit code
#
# NOTE: pipes ("|") are not supported!
#
# Special case for development:
#
# When a version is set to "dev" it will be selected no matter what. This allows to test an upgrade record's effect.
# (don't forget to set it to the next release version before releasing!)

changes:
  - version: 0.16.9 # TODO: potentially published in next release (0.16.* or 0.17.0 depending on breaking changes introduced)
