Maurice:

Seeing we have too many discussions around bash best practices we will settle for a style guide.
I don't see a point in discussing which one to choose, only to choose one that is used by very big corporation/community.
That is why I chose to start using this one:

https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html

Exceptions:

- Keep file extensions for many reasons: easy for humans, ootb detection for most editors

NOTE:

Added flags to shell-format extension: "-i 2 -ci" to come close according to https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/32151/linter-for-google-shell-style-guide
