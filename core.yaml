      maintainers: The Linux Foundation
      relatedLinks: [https://otomi.io/docs/apps/certmanager, https://cert-manager.io/]
      license: Apache 2.0
      about: Cert-manager adds certificates and certificate issuers as resource types in Kubernetes clusters, and simplifies the process of obtaining, renewing and using those certificates. It can issue certificates from a variety of supported sources, including Let's Encrypt, HashiCorp Vault, and Venafi as well as private PKI, and it ensures certificates remain valid and up to date, attempting to renew certificates at an appropriate time before expiry.
      integration: Cert-manager is used by Otomi to automatically create and rotate TLS certificates for service endpoints. You may bring your own CA, or let Otomi create one for you (default). It is recommended to use Let's Encrypt for production certificates. Setting cert-manager to use Let's Encrypt requires DNS availability of the requesting domains, and forces Otomi to install external-dns. Because a lot of DNS settings are used by other Otomi contexts, most DNS configuration is found under settings/dns.

      license: Apache 2.0
      about: Drone is a continuous delivery system built on container technology. Drone uses a simple YAML build file, to define and execute build pipelines inside Docker containers.
      integration: Otomi uses Drone to deploy changes to the configuration (values) repository. Drone is installed and configured by default. When no external source control is configured (default), Otomi will use Gitea as Drone's git hosting dependency. Teams can use Drone for other purposes if desired, with the limitation that it can't be configured for multiple git services.

      license: Apache 2.0
      about: Kubernetes allows decoupling policy decisions from the inner workings of the API Server by means of admission controller webhooks, which are executed whenever a resource is created, updated or deleted. Gatekeeper is a validating (mutating TBA) webhook that enforces CRD-based policies executed by Open Policy Agent.
      integration: OPA/Gatekeeper can be enabled for policy enforcement. The Otomi configuration repository holds a policies.yaml file with sane default policy presets. A selection of usable policies for Otomi are used by Conftest as well for static analysis of manifests generated by Otomi. YAML Resources are verified against defined .rego policy rules, using the defined preset parameters as their constraint value. When enabled, policies can be turned on/off in the Otomi web UI.

      about: Harbor is an open source trusted cloud native registry project that stores, signs, and scans content. Harbor extends the open source Docker Distribution by adding the functionalities usually required by users such as security, identity and management. Having a registry closer to the build and run environment can improve the image transfer efficiency. Harbor supports replication of images between registries, and also offers advanced security features such as user management, access control and activity auditing.
      integration: Harbor can be enabled to provide each team with a private registry. Harbor has been made user and tenant aware. Otomi runs automated tasks that take care of creating a project in Harbor for each team, creating a bot-account for each team, and creating a Kubernetes pull secret in the team namespace to enable pulling of images out of the local registry.

      license: Apache 2.0
      about: Jaeger is a distributed tracing platform. It can be used for monitoring microservices-based distributed systems. As on-the-ground microservice practitioners are quickly realizing, the majority of operational problems that arise when moving to a distributed architecture are ultimately grounded in networking and observability. It is simply an orders of magnitude larger problem to network and debug a set of intertwined distributed services versus a single monolithic application.
      integration: Jaeger can be activated to gain tracing insights on its network traffic. It runs in anonymous mode and each authenticated user is given the same authorization, allowing them to see everything.

      about: Knative Serving builds on Kubernetes to support deploying and serving of applications and functions as serverless containers. Serving is easy to get started with and scales to support advanced scenarios.
      integration: Knative serving can be activated to deliver Container-as-a-Service (CaaS) functionality with a scale-to-zero option. It can be compared to Functions-as-a-service (FaaS) but is container oriented, and takes only one manifest to configure an auto scaling service based on a container image of choice. Otomi offers an on-the-fly Knative service deployment, making it very easy to deploy containerized services without the hassle of providing all the supporting resources involved with Helm charts. Istio Virtual Services are used to route traffic coming in for a public domain to its backing Knative Service, allowing it to set a custom domain.

      about: Loki is a horizontally-scalable, highly-available, multi-tenant log aggregation system inspired by Prometheus. It is designed to be very cost effective and easy to operate. It does not index the contents of the logs, but rather a set of labels for each log stream.
      integration: Loki can be activated to aggregate all the container logs on the platform and store them in a storage endpoint of choice (defaults to PVC). When Otomi is configured in multi-tenancy mode, logs will be split-up between team namespaces and made available for team members only. Otomi shortcuts can be used to provide selections of logs based on interest.

      about: Prometheus is a systems and service monitoring system. It collects metrics from configured targets at given intervals, evaluates rule expressions, displays the results, and can trigger alerts when specified conditions are observed.
      integration: Prometheus can be activated to aggregate all platform metrics and store them in a storage endpoint of choice (defaults to PVC). When Otomi is configured in multi-tenancy mode, each team will be provided with a dedicated Prometheus instance. This instance can be used to aggregate custom team metrics.

      about: Vault is a tool for securely accessing secrets. A secret is anything that you want to tightly control access to, such as API keys, passwords, certificates, and more. Vault provides a unified interface to any secret, while providing tight access control and recording a detailed audit log.
      integration: Vault has been made team aware. When enabled, a space will automatically be created for each team, and only team members are allowed access. Vault is automatically configured to use Otomi's Keycloak OIDC settings for SSO. Vault runs natively on Kubernetes. To prevent data from Vault being lost during a rolling cluster upgrade, data persistence can be configured in combination with external (blob) storage.
