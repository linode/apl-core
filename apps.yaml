      - https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager]
    license: Apache 2.0
    about: Alertmanager handles alerts sent by client applications such as the Prometheus server. It takes care of de-duplicating, grouping, and routing them to the correct receiver integration such as email, PagerDuty, or OpsGenie. Alertmanager also takes care of silencing and inhibition of alerts.
    integration: Alertmanager can be activated to send alerts to configured receivers. It is configured by Otomi to use the global values found under settings/alerts. A team can override global settings to send alerts to their own endpoints.
  argocd:

      - https://otomi.io/docs/apps/argocd
      - https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io
    license: Apache 2.0
    about: Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes.
    integration: Argo CD is configured by Otomi to use the SSO provided by keycloak, and maps otomi groups to Argo CD roles. The otomi-admin role is made super admin within Argo CD. The team-admin role has access to Argo CD and is admin of all team projects. Members of team roles are only allowed to administer their own projects. All Teams will automatically get access to a Git repo, and Argo CD is configured to listen to this repo. All a team has to do is to fill their repo with intended state, commit, and automation takes care of the rest.
  cert-manager:
    title: CertManager
    appVersion: 1.10.0
    repo: https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager
    maintainers: The Linux Foundation
    relatedLinks:
      - https://otomi.io/docs/apps/certmanager
      - https://cert-manager.io/
    license: Apache 2.0
    about: Cert-manager adds certificates and certificate issuers as resource types in Kubernetes clusters, and simplifies the process of obtaining, renewing and using those certificates. It can issue certificates from a variety of supported sources, including Let's Encrypt, HashiCorp Vault, and Venafi as well as private PKI, and it ensures certificates remain valid and up to date, attempting to renew certificates at an appropriate time before expiry.
    integration: Cert-manager is used by Otomi to automatically create and rotate TLS certificates for service endpoints. You may bring your own CA, or let Otomi create one for you (default). It is recommended to use Let's Encrypt for production certificates. Setting cert-manager to use Let's Encrypt requires DNS availability of the requesting domains, and forces Otomi to install external-dns. Because a lot of DNS settings are used by other Otomi contexts, most DNS configuration is found under settings/dns.
  drone:

      - https://falco.org/docs
    license: Apache 2.0
    about: Falco is an open source cloud native runtime security tool that makes it easy to consume kernel events, and enrich those events with information from Kubernetes. Falco has a rich set of security rules specifically built for Kubernetes and Linux. If a rule is violated in a system, Falco will send an alert notifying the user of the violation and its severity.
    integration: Falco can be enabled in Otomi for runtime intrusion detection. Macros have been configured to exclude all known platform violations so platform admins are only notified when user workloads are not compliant to the security rules. Alerts are automatically send using Alertmanager and the Falco Dashboard is added to Grafana.
  gatekeeper:

      - https://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper/website/docs/
    license: Apache 2.0
    about: Kubernetes allows decoupling policy decisions from the inner workings of the API Server by means of admission controller webhooks, which are executed whenever a resource is created, updated or deleted. Gatekeeper is a validating (mutating TBA) webhook that enforces CRD-based policies executed by Open Policy Agent.
    integration: OPA/Gatekeeper can be enabled for policy enforcement. The Otomi configuration repository holds a policies.yaml file with sane default policy presets. A selection of usable policies for Otomi are used by Conftest as well for static analysis of manifests generated by Otomi. YAML Resources are verified against defined .rego policy rules, using the defined preset parameters as their constraint value. When enabled, policies can be turned on/off in the Otomi web UI.

    about: Gitea is a painless self-hosted Git service. It is similar to GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab. Gitea is a fork of Gogs. See the Gitea Announcement blog post to read about the justification for a fork.
    integration: Otomi uses Gitea as its default repository for otomi configuration (values). Gitea can also be used by Teams to provide application code repositories. Access to Gitea is provided by the OIDC integration in Otomi. Members of the otomi-admin and team-admin group can seamlessly sign in to Gitea. When Argo CD is enabled, Otomi will automatically create a Gitops repository for each Team in Gitea.

Harbor supports replication of images between registries, and also offers advanced security features such as user management, access control and activity auditing.
    integration: Harbor can be enabled to provide each team with a private registry. Harbor has been made user and tenant aware. Otomi runs automated tasks that take care of creating a project in Harbor for each team, creating a bot-account for each team, and creating a Kubernetes pull secret in the team namespace to enable pulling of images out of the local registry.

    integration: Otomi has security best practices built in, and is designed for intrusion. Istio is used by Otomi as a service mesh to deliver mTLS enforcement for all traffic that is deemed compromisable, egress control to force teams to choose explicit egress endpoints, and advanced routing capabilities such as weight based load balancing (A/B or blue/green testing). Istio is part of the core of Otomi and can not be disabled.
  jaeger:

    license: Apache 2.0
    about: Jaeger is a distributed tracing platform. It can be used for monitoring microservices-based distributed systems. As on-the-ground microservice practitioners are quickly realizing, the majority of operational problems that arise when moving to a distributed architecture are ultimately grounded in networking and observability. It is simply an orders of magnitude larger problem to network and debug a set of intertwined distributed services versus a single monolithic application.
    integration: Jaeger can be activated to gain tracing insights on its network traffic. It runs in anonymous mode and each authenticated user is given the same authorization, allowing them to see everything.

    about: Knative Serving builds on Kubernetes to support deploying and serving of applications and functions as serverless containers. Serving is easy to get started with and scales to support advanced scenarios.
    integration: Knative serving can be activated to deliver Container-as-a-Service (CaaS) functionality with a scale-to-zero option. It can be compared to Functions-as-a-service (FaaS) but is container oriented, and takes only one manifest to configure an auto scaling service based on a container image of choice. Otomi offers an on-the-fly Knative service deployment, making it very easy to deploy containerized services without the hassle of providing all the supporting resources involved with Helm charts. Istio Virtual Services are used to route traffic coming in for a public domain to its backing Knative Service, allowing it to set a custom domain.
