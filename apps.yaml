      - https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager
    license: Apache 2.0
    dependencies: Prometheus
    about: Alertmanager handles alerts sent by client applications such as the Prometheus server. It takes care of de-duplicating, grouping, and routing them to the correct receiver integration such as email, PagerDuty, or OpsGenie. Alertmanager also takes care of silencing and inhibition of alerts.

All Teams will automatically get access to a Git repo, and Argo CD is configured to listen to this repo. All a team has to do is to fill their repo with intended state, commit, and automation takes care of the rest.
  cert-manager:
    title: Cert-manager
    appVersion: 1.19.1
    repo: https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager
    maintainers: The Linux Foundation
    relatedLinks:
      - https://cert-manager.io/
    license: Apache 2.0
    about: Cert-manager adds certificates and certificate issuers as resource types in Kubernetes clusters, and simplifies the process of obtaining, renewing and using those certificates. It can issue certificates from a variety of supported sources, including Let's Encrypt, HashiCorp Vault, and Venafi as well as private PKI, and it ensures certificates remain valid and up to date, attempting to renew certificates at an appropriate time before expiry.
    integration: Cert-manager is used by App Platform to automatically create and rotate TLS certificates for service endpoints. You may bring your own CA, or let App Platform create one for you (default). It is recommended to use Let's Encrypt for production certificates. Setting cert-manager to use Let's Encrypt requires DNS availability of the requesting domains, and forces App Platform to install external-dns. Because a lot of DNS settings are used by other App Platform contexts, most DNS configuration is found under settings/dns.

It can be compared to Functions-as-a-service (FaaS) but is container oriented, and takes only one manifest to configure an auto scaling service based on a container image of choice. App Platform offers an on-the-fly Knative service deployment, making it very easy to deploy containerized services without the hassle of providing all the supporting resources involved with Helm charts. Istio Virtual Services are used to route traffic coming in for a public domain to its backing Knative Service, allowing it to set a custom domain.
