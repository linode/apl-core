    about: Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes.
    integration: Argo CD is configured by Otomi to use the SSO provided by keycloak, and maps otomi groups to Argo CD roles. The otomi-admin role is made super admin within Argo CD. The team-admin role has access to Argo CD and is admin of all team projects. Members of team roles are only allowed to administer their own projects. All Teams will automatically get access to a Git repo, and Argo CD is configured to listen to this repo. All a team has to do is to fill their repo with intended state, commit, and automation takes care of the rest.
  cert-manager:
    title: CertManager
    appVersion: 1.8.0
    repo: https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager
    maintainers: The Linux Foundation
    relatedLinks:
      - https://otomi.io/docs/apps/certmanager
      - https://cert-manager.io/
    license: Apache 2.0
    about: Cert-manager adds certificates and certificate issuers as resource types in Kubernetes clusters, and simplifies the process of obtaining, renewing and using those certificates. It can issue certificates from a variety of supported sources, including Let's Encrypt, HashiCorp Vault, and Venafi as well as private PKI, and it ensures certificates remain valid and up to date, attempting to renew certificates at an appropriate time before expiry.
    integration: Cert-manager is used by Otomi to automatically create and rotate TLS certificates for service endpoints. You may bring your own CA, or let Otomi create one for you (default). It is recommended to use Let's Encrypt for production certificates. Setting cert-manager to use Let's Encrypt requires DNS availability of the requesting domains, and forces Otomi to install external-dns. Because a lot of DNS settings are used by other Otomi contexts, most DNS configuration is found under settings/dns.
