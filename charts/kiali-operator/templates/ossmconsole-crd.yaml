# The operator will watch resources of this kind and install OSSMC when one is found.
# This CRD needs to be templated because we do not want it installed on non-OpenShift clusters.
# However, the crds/ directory is not templated by Helm. See the Helm documentation on this here:
# https://helm.sh/docs/chart_best_practices/custom_resource_definitions/#method-1-let-helm-do-it-for-you
# Therefore, this CRD declaration is in templates/. The operator helm chart does not create resources
# of this kind, so this should be OK. Just realize if you uninstall the operator, this CRD will also
# be uninstalled (and thus any existing OSSMC CR will also be purged).
