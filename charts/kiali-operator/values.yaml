# This helm chart will create Kubernetes resources such as cluster roles, cluster role bindings, and service accounts.
# For very rare use-cases, users may want to manage some of these resources manually, outside
# of this helm chart. In cases like this, you can inform this helm chart to skip the creation of
# those resources that you want to manage yourself.
# For example, if you want to manage cluster roles and cluster role bindings yourself, but you still want this helm
# chart to create service accounts, set the value of "skipResources" to an array
# value of ["clusterrole", "clusterrolebinding"].
# If you use this feature, you must be aware that you then bear the responsibility of
# creating these resources yourself manually; if you do not then the installation
# will be broken. Therefore, only use this feature if you know what you are doing.
# Valid list item values are: "clusterrole", "clusterrolebinding", "sa"

# The first two are for OpenShift only, the last two are for non-OpenShift Kubernetes clusters. The two with "-ns" in their name
# enable the operator to automatically update the Kiali Server with access to new namespaces as those namespaces are created in
# the cluster. This namespace watching feature provides some advanced capabilities but is never required. It is also not
# the default behavior and is not necessary if your Kiali CRs will have `spec.deployment.cluster_wide_access` set to `true`.
