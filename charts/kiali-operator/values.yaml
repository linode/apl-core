# allowAllAccessibleNamespaces tells the operator to allow a user to be able to configure Kiali

# The first two are for OpenShift only, the last two are for non-OpenShift Kubernetes clusters. The two with "-ns" in their name
# enable the operator to automatically update the Kiali Server with access to new namespaces as those namespaces are created in
# the cluster. This namespace watching feature provides some advanced capabilities but is never required. It is also not
# the default behavior and is not necessary if your Kiali CRs will have `spec.deployment.cluster_wide_access` set to `true`.
