                  A list of additional details that Kiali will look for in annotations. When found on any workload or service, Kiali will display the additional details in the respective workload or service details page. This is typically used to inject some CI metadata or documentation links into Kiali views. For example, by default, Kiali will recognize these annotations on a service or workload (e.g. a Deployment, StatefulSet, etc.):
                  ```

                description: |
                  The version of the Ansible role that will be executed in order to install Kiali.
                  This also indirectly determines the version of Kiali that will be installed.
                  You normally will want to use `default` since this is the only officially supported value today.

                  If not specified, the value of `default` is assumed which means the most recent Ansible role is used;
                  thus the most recent release of Kiali will be installed.

                  Refer to this file to see what the valid values are for this `version` field (as defined in the master branch),
                  https://github.com/kiali/kiali-operator/blob/master/playbooks/kiali-default-supported-images.yml

                  This `version` setting affects the defaults of the `deployment.image_name` and
                  `deployment.image_version` settings. See the documentation for those settings below for
                  additional details. In short, this `version` setting will dictate which version of the
                  Kiali image will be deployed by default. However, if you explicitly set `deployment.image_name`
                  and/or `deployment.image_version` to reference your own custom image, that will override the
                  default Kiali image to be installed; therefore, you are responsible for ensuring those settings
                  are compatible with the Ansible role that will be executed in order to install Kiali (i.e. your
                  custom Kiali image must be compatible with the rest of the configuration and resources the
                  operator will install).

                      Determines what authentication strategy to use when users log into Kiali.
                      Options are `anonymous`, `token`, `openshift`, `openid`, or `header`.

                      * Choose `anonymous` to allow full access to Kiali without requiring any credentials.
                      * Choose `token` to allow access to Kiali using service account tokens, which controls
                      access based on RBAC roles assigned to the service account.
                      * Choose `openshift` to use the OpenShift OAuth login which controls access based on
                      the individual's RBAC roles in OpenShift. Not valid for non-OpenShift environments.
                      * Choose `openid` to enable OpenID Connect-based authentication. Your cluster is required to
                      be configured to accept the tokens issued by your IdP. There are additional required
                      configurations for this strategy. See below for the additional OpenID configuration section.
                      * Choose `header` when Kiali is running behind a reverse proxy that will inject an
                      Authorization header and potentially impersonation headers.

                      When empty, this value will default to `openshift` on OpenShift and `token` on other Kubernetes environments.

                          configuration (Ingress on Kubernetes and Route on OpenShift). It is up to the user
                          to ensure this override YAML configuration is valid and supports the cluster environment
                          since the operator will blindly copy this custom configuration into the resource it
                          creates.

                          This setting is not used if `deployment.ingress.enabled` is set to 'false'.
                          Note that only 'metadata.annotations' and 'spec' is valid and only they will
                          be used to override those same sections in the created resource. You can define
                          either one or both.

                          Note that `override_yaml.metadata.labels` is not allowed - you cannot override the labels; to add
                          labels to the default set of labels, use the `deployment.ingress.additional_labels` setting.

                  These external service configuration settings define how to connect to the external services
                  like Prometheus, Grafana, and Jaeger.

                  Regarding sensitive values in the external_services 'auth' sections:
                  Some external services configured below support an 'auth' sub-section in order to tell Kiali
                  how it should authenticate with the external services. Credentials used to authenticate Kiali
                  to those external services can be defined in the `auth.password` and `auth.token` values
                  within the `auth` sub-section. Because these are sensitive values, you may not want to declare
                  the actual credentials here in the Kiali CR. In this case, you may store the actual password
                  or token string in a Kubernetes secret. If you do, you need to set the `auth.password` or
                  `auth.token` to a value in the format `secret:<secretName>:<secretKey>` where `<secretName>`
                  is the name of the secret object that Kiali can access, and `<secretKey>` is the name of the
                  key within the named secret that contains the actual password or token string. For example,
                  if Grafana requires a password, you can store that password in a secret named 'myGrafanaCredentials'
                  in a key named 'myGrafanaPw'. In this case, you would set `external_services.grafana.auth.password`
                  to `secret:myGrafanaCredentials:myGrafanaPw`.
