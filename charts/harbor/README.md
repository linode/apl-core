# Helm Chart for Harbor

**Notes:** The master branch is in heavy development, please use the other stable versions instead. A high available solution for Harbor based on chart can be find [here](docs/High%20Availability.md). And refer to the [guide](docs/Upgrade.md) to upgrade the existing deployment.

This repository, including the issues, focus on deploying Harbor chart via helm.  So for the functionality issues or questions of Harbor, please open issues on [goharbor/harbor](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor)

## Introduction

This [Helm](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm) chart installs [Harbor](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor) in a Kubernetes cluster. Welcome to [contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md) to Helm Chart for Harbor.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster 1.10+
- Helm 2.8.0+

## Installation

### Add Helm repository

```bash
helm repo add harbor https://helm.goharbor.io
```

### Configure the chart

The following items can be set via `--set` flag during installation or configured by editing the `values.yaml` directly(need to download the chart first).

#### Configure the way how to expose Harbor service

- **Ingress**: The ingress controller must be installed in the Kubernetes cluster.
  **Notes:** if the TLS is disabled, the port must be included in the command when pulling/pushing images. Refer to issue [#5291](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/issues/5291) for the detail.
- **ClusterIP**: Exposes the service on a cluster-internal IP. Choosing this value makes the service only reachable from within the cluster.
- **NodePort**: Exposes the service on each Node’s IP at a static port (the NodePort). You’ll be able to contact the NodePort service, from outside the cluster, by requesting `NodeIP:NodePort`.
- **LoadBalancer**: Exposes the service externally using a cloud provider’s load balancer.

#### Configure the external URL

The external URL for Harbor core service is used to:

1. populate the docker/helm commands showed on portal
2. populate the token service URL returned to docker/notary client

Format: `protocol://domain[:port]`. Usually:

- if expose the service via `Ingress`, the `domain` should be the value of `expose.ingress.hosts.core`
- if expose the service via `ClusterIP`, the `domain` should be the value of `expose.clusterIP.name`
- if expose the service via `NodePort`, the `domain` should be the IP address of one Kubernetes node
- if expose the service via `LoadBalancer`, set the `domain` as your own domain name and add a CNAME record to map the domain name to the one you got from the cloud provider

If Harbor is deployed behind the proxy, set it as the URL of proxy.

#### Configure the way how to persistent data

- **Disable**: The data does not survive the termination of a pod.
- **Persistent Volume Claim(default)**: A default `StorageClass` is needed in the Kubernetes cluster to dynamic provision the volumes. Specify another StorageClass in the `storageClass` or set `existingClaim` if you have already existing persistent volumes to use.
- **External Storage(only for images and charts)**: For images and charts, the external storages are supported: `azure`, `gcs`, `s3` `swift` and `oss`.

#### Configure the secrets

- **Secret keys**: Secret keys are used for secure communication between components. Fill `core.secret`, `jobservice.secret` and `registry.secret` to configure.
- **Certificates**:
  - *notary*: Used for authentication during communications. Fill `notary.secretName` to configure. Notary server certificate must be issued with notary service name as subject alternative name.
  - *core*: Used for token encryption/decryption. Fill `core.secretName` to configure.

Secrets and certificates must be setup to avoid changes on every Helm upgrade (see: [#107](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor-helm/issues/107)).

#### Configure the other items listed in [configuration](#configuration) section

### Install the chart

Install the Harbor helm chart with a release name `my-release`:

helm 2:
```bash
helm install --name my-release harbor/harbor
```
helm 3:
```bash
helm install my-release harbor/harbor
```

## Uninstallation

To uninstall/delete the `my-release` deployment:

helm 2:
```bash
helm delete --purge my-release
```
helm 3:
```
helm uninstall my-release
```

## Configuration

The following table lists the configurable parameters of the Harbor chart and the default values.

| `registry.credentials.htpasswd` | The content of htpasswd file based on the value of `registry.credentials.username` `registry.credentials.password`.  Currently `helm` does not support bcrypt in the template script, if the credential is updated you need to manually generated by calling [htpasswd](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/htpasswd.html): `htpasswd -nbBC10 $username $password`.
