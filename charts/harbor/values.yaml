  # gitHubToken the GitHub access token to download Trivy DB
  #
  # Trivy DB contains vulnerability information from NVD, Red Hat, and many other upstream vulnerability databases.
  # It is downloaded by Trivy from the GitHub release page https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy-db/releases and cached
  # in the local file system (`/home/scanner/.cache/trivy/db/trivy.db`). In addition, the database contains the update
  # timestamp so Trivy can detect whether it should download a newer version from the Internet or use the cached one.
  # Currently, the database is updated every 12 hours and published as a new release to GitHub.
  #
  # Anonymous downloads from GitHub are subject to the limit of 60 requests per hour. Normally such rate limit is enough
  # for production operations. If, for any reason, it's not enough, you could increase the rate limit to 5000
  # requests per hour by specifying the GitHub access token. For more details on GitHub rate limiting please consult
  # https://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting
  #
  # You can create a GitHub token by following the instructions in
  # https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line

  # skipUpdate the flag to disable Trivy DB downloads from GitHub
  #
  # You might want to set the value of this flag to `true` in test or CI/CD environments to avoid GitHub rate limiting issues.

  # `/home/scanner/.cache/trivy/db/trivy.db` path.
  skipUpdate: false

  # The offlineScan option prevents Trivy from sending API requests to identify dependencies.

  # For example, the offline mode will not try to resolve transitive dependencies in pom.xml when the dependency doesn't
  # exist in the local repositories. It means a number of detected vulnerabilities might be fewer in offline mode.
  # It would work if all the dependencies are in local.
