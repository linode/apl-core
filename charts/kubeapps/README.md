# Kubeapps

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/kubeapps/kubeapps/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/kubeapps/kubeapps/tree/master)

[Kubeapps](https://kubeapps.com) is a web-based UI for deploying and managing applications in Kubernetes clusters. Kubeapps allows you to:

- Browse and deploy [Helm](https://github.com/helm/helm) charts from chart repositories
- Inspect, upgrade and delete Helm-based applications installed in the cluster
- Add custom and private chart repositories (supports [ChartMuseum](https://github.com/helm/chartmuseum) and [JFrog Artifactory](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/Helm+Chart+Repositories))
- Browse and deploy [Kubernetes Operators](https://operatorhub.io/).
- Secure authentication to Kubeapps using an [OAuth2/OIDC provider](https://github.com/kubeapps/kubeapps/blob/master/docs/user/using-an-OIDC-provider.md)
- Secure authorization based on Kubernetes [Role-Based Access Control](https://github.com/kubeapps/kubeapps/blob/master/docs/user/access-control.md)

## TL;DR

```bash
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
kubectl create namespace kubeapps
helm install kubeapps --namespace kubeapps bitnami/kubeapps
```

> Check out the [getting started](https://github.com/kubeapps/kubeapps/blob/master/docs/user/getting-started.md) to start deploying apps with Kubeapps.

## Introduction

This chart bootstraps a [Kubeapps](https://kubeapps.com) deployment on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

It also packages the [Bitnami PostgreSQL chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/postgresql) which is required for bootstrapping a deployment for the database requirements of the Kubeapps application.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.15+ (tested with Azure Kubernetes Service, Google Kubernetes Engine, minikube and Docker for Desktop Kubernetes)
- Helm 3.0.2+
- Administrative access to the cluster to create Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `kubeapps`:

```bash
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
kubectl create namespace kubeapps
helm install kubeapps --namespace kubeapps bitnami/kubeapps
```

The command deploys Kubeapps on the Kubernetes cluster in the `kubeapps` namespace. The [Parameters](#parameters) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

> **Caveat**: Only one Kubeapps installation is supported per namespace

Once you have installed Kubeapps follow the [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/kubeapps/kubeapps/blob/master/docs/user/getting-started.md) for additional information on how to access and use Kubeapps.

## Parameters

For a full list of configuration parameters of the Kubeapps chart, see the [values.yaml](values.yaml) file.

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`. For example,

```bash
helm install kubeapps --namespace kubeapps \
  --set ingress.enabled=true \
    bitnami/kubeapps
```

The above command enables an Ingress Rule to expose Kubeapps.

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for parameters can be provided while installing the chart. For example,

```bash
helm install kubeapps --namespace kubeapps -f custom-values.yaml bitnami/kubeapps
```

## Configuration and installation details

### Configuring Initial Repositories

By default, Kubeapps will track the [community Helm charts](https://github.com/helm/charts) and the [Kubernetes Service Catalog charts](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/service-catalog). To change these defaults, override with your desired parameters the `apprepository.initialRepos` object present in the [values.yaml](values.yaml) file.

### Enabling Operators

Since v1.9.0 (and by default since v2.0), Kubeapps supports to deploy and manage Operators within its dashboard. More information about how to enable and use this feature can be found in [this guide](https://github.com/kubeapps/kubeapps/blob/master/docs/user/operators.md).

### Exposing Externally

> **Note**: The Kubeapps frontend sets up a proxy to the Kubernetes API service which means that when exposing the Kubeapps service to a network external to the Kubernetes cluster (perhaps on an internal or public network), the Kubernetes API will also be exposed for authenticated requests from that network. It is highly recommended that you [use an OAuth2/OIDC provider with Kubeapps](https://github.com/kubeapps/kubeapps/blob/master/docs/user/using-an-OIDC-provider.md) to ensure that your authentication proxy is exposed rather than the Kubeapps frontend. This ensures that only the configured users trusted by your Identity Provider will be able to reach the Kubeapps frontend and therefore the Kubernetes API. Kubernetes service token authentication should only be used for users for demonstration purposes only, not production environments.

#### LoadBalancer Service

The simplest way to expose the Kubeapps Dashboard is to assign a LoadBalancer type to the Kubeapps frontend Service. For example, you can use the following parameter: `frontend.service.type=LoadBalancer`

Wait for your cluster to assign a LoadBalancer IP or Hostname to the `kubeapps` Service and access it on that address:

```bash
kubectl get services --namespace kubeapps --watch
```

#### Ingress

This chart provides support for ingress resources. If you have an ingress controller installed on your cluster, such as [nginx-ingress](https://hub.kubeapps.com/charts/stable/nginx-ingress) or [traefik](https://hub.kubeapps.com/charts/stable/traefik) you can utilize the ingress controller to expose Kubeapps.

To enable ingress integration, please set `ingress.enabled` to `true`

##### Hosts

Most likely you will only want to have one hostname that maps to this Kubeapps installation (use the `ingress.hostname` parameter to set the hostname), however, it is possible to have more than one host. To facilitate this, the `ingress.extraHosts` object is an array.

If you plan to serve Kubeapps under a subpath (eg., `example.com/subpath`), you will have to disable the default path by setting `ingress.hostname=""` and the enter the hostname and path in the extraHost array; for instance: `ingress.extraHosts[0].name="example.com"` and `ingress.extraHosts[0].path="/subpath"`
##### Annotations

For annotations, please see [this document](https://github.com/kubeapps/kubeapps/blob/master/docs/user-guide/nginx-configuration/annotations.md). Not all annotations are supported by all ingress controllers, but this document does a good job of indicating which annotation is supported by many popular ingress controllers. Annotations can be set using `ingress.annotations`.

##### TLS

This chart will facilitate the creation of TLS secrets for use with the ingress controller, however, this is not required. There are four common use cases:

- Helm generates/manages certificate secrets based on the parameters.
- User generates/manages certificates separately.
- Helm creates self-signed certificates and generates/manages certificate secrets.
- An additional tool (like [cert-manager](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/)) manages the secrets for the application.

In the first two cases, it's needed a certificate and a key. We would expect them to look like this:

- certificate files should look like (and there can be more than one certificate if there is a certificate chain)

  ```console
  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  MIID6TCCAtGgAwIBAgIJAIaCwivkeB5EMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBCwUAMFYxCzAJBgNV
  ...
  jScrvkiBO65F46KioCL9h5tDvomdU1aqpI/CBzhvZn1c0ZTf87tGQR8NK7v7
  -----END CERTIFICATE-----
  ```

- keys should look like:

  ```console
  -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
  MIIEogIBAAKCAQEAvLYcyu8f3skuRyUgeeNpeDvYBCDcgq+LsWap6zbX5f8oLqp4
  ...
  wrj2wDbCDCFmfqnSJ+dKI3vFLlEz44sAV8jX/kd4Y6ZTQhlLbYc=
  -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
  ```

- If you are going to use Helm to manage the certificates based on the parameters, please copy these values into the `certificate` and `key` values for a given `ingress.secrets` entry.
- In case you are going to manage TLS secrects separately, please know that you can must a TLS secret with name *INGRESS_HOSTNAME-tls* (where *INGRESS_HOSTNAME* is a placeholder to be replaced with the hostname you set using the `ingress.hostname` parameter).
- To use self-signed certificates created by Helm, set `ingress.tls` to `true` and `ingress.certManager` to `false`.
- If your cluster has a [cert-manager](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager) add-on to automate the management and issuance of TLS certificates, set `ingress.certManager` boolean to true to enable the corresponding annotations for cert-manager.

## Upgrading Kubeapps

You can upgrade Kubeapps from the Kubeapps web interface. Select the namespace in which Kubeapps is installed (`kubeapps` if you followed the instructions in this guide) and click on the "Upgrade" button. Select the new version and confirm.

You can also use the Helm CLI to upgrade Kubeapps, first ensure you have updated your local chart repository cache:

```bash
helm repo update
```

Now upgrade Kubeapps:

```bash
export RELEASE_NAME=kubeapps
helm upgrade $RELEASE_NAME bitnami/kubeapps
```

If you find issues upgrading Kubeapps, check the [troubleshooting](#error-while-upgrading-the-chart) section.

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `kubeapps` deployment:

```bash
helm uninstall -n kubeapps kubeapps

# Optional: Only if there are no more instances of Kubeapps
kubectl delete crd apprepositories.kubeapps.com
```

The first command removes most of the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release. After that, if there are no more instances of Kubeapps in the cluster you can manually delete the `apprepositories.kubeapps.com` CRD used by Kubeapps that is shared for the entire cluster.

> **NOTE**: If you delete the CRD for `apprepositories.kubeapps.com` it will delete the repositories for **all** the installed instances of `kubeapps`. This will break existing installations of `kubeapps` if they exist.

If you have dedicated a namespace only for Kubeapps you can completely clean the remaining completed/failed jobs or any stale resources by deleting the namespace

```bash
kubectl delete namespace kubeapps
```

### How to install Kubeapps for demo purposes?

Install Kubeapps for exclusively **demo purposes** by simply following the [getting started](https://github.com/kubeapps/kubeapps/blob/master/docs/user/getting-started.md) docs.

### How to install Kubeapps in production scenarios?

For any user-facing installation, you should [configure an OAuth2/OIDC provider](https://github.com/kubeapps/kubeapps/blob/master/docs/user/using-an-OIDC-provider.md) to enable secure user authentication with Kubeapps and the cluster.
Please also refer to the [Access Control](https://github.com/kubeapps/kubeapps/blob/master/docs/user/access-control.md) documentation to configure fine-grained access control for users.

### How to use Kubeapps?

Have a look at the [dashboard documentation](https://github.com/kubeapps/kubeapps/blob/master/docs/user/dashboard.md) for knowing how to use the Kubeapps dashboard: deploying applications, listing and removing the applications running in your cluster and adding new repositories.

### How to configure Kubeapps with Ingress

The example below will match the URL `http://example.com` to the Kubeapps dashboard. For further configuration, please refer to your specific Ingress configuration docs (e.g., [NGINX](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx) or [HAProxy](https://github.com/haproxytech/kubernetes-ingress)).

```bash
helm install kubeapps --namespace kubeapps \
  --set ingress.enabled=true \
  --set ingress.hostname=example.com \
    bitnami/kubeapps
```
#### Serving Kubeapps in a subpath

You may want to serve Kubeapps with a subpath, for instance `http://example.com/subpath`, you have to set the proper Ingress configuration. If you are using the ingress configuration provided by the Kubeapps chart, you will have to set the `ingress.extraHosts` parameter:

```bash
helm install kubeapps --namespace kubeapps \
    --set ingress.enabled=true
    --set ingress.hostname=""
    --set ingress.extraHosts[0].name="console.example.com"
    --set ingress.extraHosts[0].path="/catalog"
    bitnami/kubeapps
```
Besides, if you are using the OAuth2/OIDC login (more information at the [using an OIDC provider documentation](https://github.com/kubeapps/kubeapps/blob/master/docs/user/using-an-OIDC-provider.md)), you will need, also, to configure the different URLs:

```bash
helm install kubeapps bitnami/kubeapps \
  --namespace kubeapps \
  # ... other OIDC flags 
  --set authProxy.oauthLoginURI="/subpath/oauth2/login" \
  --set authProxy.oauthLogoutURI="/subpath/oauth2/logout" \
  --set authProxy.additionalFlags="{<other flags>,--proxy-prefix=/subpath/oauth2}"
```

### Can Kubeapps install apps into more than one cluster?

Yes! Kubeapps 2.0+ supports multicluster environments. Have a look at the [Kubeapps dashboard documentation](https://github.com/kubeapps/kubeapps/blob/master/docs/user/deploying-to-multiple-clusters.md) to know more.

### Can Kubeapps be installed without Internet connection?

Yes! Follow the [offline installation documentation](https://github.com/kubeapps/kubeapps/blob/master/docs/user/offline-installation.md) to discover how to perform an installation in an air-gapped scenario.

### Does Kubeapps support private repositories?

Of course! Have a look at the [private app repositories documentation](https://github.com/kubeapps/kubeapps/blob/master/docs/user/private-app-repository.md) to learn how to configure a private repository in Kubeapps.

### Is there any API documentation?

Yes! But it is not definitive and is still subject to change. Check out the [latest API online documentation](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/kubeapps/Kubeapps) or download the Kubeapps [OpenAPI Specification yaml file](./dashboard/public/openapi.yaml) from the repository.

### Why can't I configure global private repositories?

You can, but you will need to configure the `imagePullSecrets` manually.

Kubeapps does not allow you to add `imagePullSecrets` to an AppRepository that is available to the whole cluster because it would require that Kubeapps copies those secrets to the target namespace when a user deploys an app.

If you create a global AppRepository but the images are on a private registry requiring `imagePullSecrets`, the best way to configure that is to ensure your [Kubernetes nodes are configured with the required `imagePullSecrets`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#configuring-nodes-to-authenticate-to-a-private-registry) - this allows all users (of those nodes) to use those images in their deployments without ever requiring access to the secrets.

You could alternatively ensure that the `imagePullSecret` is available in all namespaces in which you want people to deploy, but this unnecessarily compromises the secret.

### Does Kubeapps support Operators?

Yes! You can get started by following the [operators documentation](https://github.com/kubeapps/kubeapps/blob/master/docs/user/operators.md).

### More questions? 

Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/kubeapps/kubeapps/issues/new) if you have any questions! 


## Troubleshooting

### Nginx Ipv6 error

When starting the application with the `--set enableIPv6=true` option, the Nginx server present in the services `kubeapps` and `kubeapps-internal-dashboard` may fail with the following:

```
nginx: [emerg] socket() [::]:8080 failed (97: Address family not supported by protocol)
```

This usually means that your cluster is not compatible with IPv6. To disable it, install kubeapps with the flag: `--set enableIPv6=false`.

### Forbidden error while installing the Chart

If during installation you run into an error similar to:

```
Error: release kubeapps failed: clusterroles.rbac.authorization.k8s.io "kubeapps-apprepository-controller" is forbidden: attempt to grant extra privileges: [{[get] [batch] [cronjobs] [] []...
```

Or:

```
Error: namespaces "kubeapps" is forbidden: User "system:serviceaccount:kube-system:default" cannot get namespaces in the namespace "kubeapps"
```

It is possible, though uncommon, that your cluster does not have Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) enabled. To check if your cluster has RBAC you can execute:

```bash
kubectl api-versions
```

If the above command does not include entries for `rbac.authorization.k8s.io` you should perform the chart installation by setting `rbac.create=false`:

```bash
helm install --name kubeapps --namespace kubeapps bitnami/kubeapps --set rbac.create=false
```

### Error while upgrading the Chart

It is possible that when upgrading Kubeapps an error appears. That can be caused by a breaking change in the new chart or because the current chart installation is in an inconsistent state. If you find issues upgrading Kubeapps you can follow these steps:

> Note: These steps assume that you have installed Kubeapps in the namespace `kubeapps` using the name `kubeapps`. If that is not the case replace the command with your namespace and/or name.

> Note: If you are upgrading from 1.X to 2.X see the [following section](#upgrading-to-2-0).

1.  (Optional) Backup your personal repositories (if you have any):

```bash
kubectl get apprepository -A -o yaml > <repo name>.yaml
```

2.  Delete Kubeapps:

```bash
helm del --purge kubeapps
```

3.  (Optional) Delete the App Repositories CRD:

> **Warning**: Don't execute this step if you have more than one Kubeapps installation in your cluster.

```bash
kubectl delete crd apprepositories.kubeapps.com
```

4.  (Optional) Clean the Kubeapps namespace:

> **Warning**: Don't execute this step if you have workloads other than Kubeapps in the `kubeapps` namespace.

```bash
kubectl delete namespace kubeapps
```

5.  Install the latest version of Kubeapps (using any custom modifications you need):

```bash
helm repo update
helm install --name kubeapps --namespace kubeapps bitnami/kubeapps
```

6.  (Optional) Restore any repositories you backed up in the first step:

```bash
kubectl apply -f <repo name>.yaml
```

After that you should be able to access the new version of Kubeapps. If the above doesn't work for you or you run into any other issues please open an [issue](https://github.com/kubeapps/kubeapps/issues/new).

### Upgrading to 2.0.1 (Chart 5.0.0)

[On November 13, 2020, Helm 2 support was formally finished](https://github.com/helm/charts#status-of-the-project), this major version is the result of the required changes applied to the Helm Chart to be able to incorporate the different features added in Helm 3 and to be consistent with the Helm project itself regarding the Helm 2 EOL.

**What changes were introduced in this major version?**

- Previous versions of this Helm Chart use `apiVersion: v1` (installable by both Helm 2 and 3), this Helm Chart was updated to `apiVersion: v2` (installable by Helm 3 only). [Here](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/#the-apiversion-field) you can find more information about the `apiVersion` field.
- Move dependency information from the *requirements.yaml* to the *Chart.yaml*
- After running `helm dependency update`, a *Chart.lock* file is generated containing the same structure used in the previous *requirements.lock*
- The different fields present in the *Chart.yaml* file has been ordered alphabetically in a homogeneous way for all the Bitnami Helm Charts
- In the case of PostgreSQL subchart, apart from the same changes that are described in this section, there are also other major changes due to the master/slave nomenclature was replaced by primary/readReplica. [Here](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/pull/4385) you can find more information about the changes introduced.

**Considerations when upgrading to this version**

- If you want to upgrade to this version using Helm 2, this scenario is not supported as this version doesn't support Helm 2 anymore
- If you installed the previous version with Helm 2 and wants to upgrade to this version with Helm 3, please refer to the [official Helm documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/v2_v3_migration/#migration-use-cases) about migrating from Helm 2 to 3
- If you want to upgrade to this version from a previous one installed with Helm 3, you shouldn't face any issues related to the new `apiVersion`. Due to the PostgreSQL major version bump, it's necessary to remove the existing statefulsets:

> Note: The command below assumes that Kubeapps has been deployed in the kubeapps namespace using "kubeapps" as release name, if that's not the case, adapt the command accordingly.

```console
$ kubectl delete statefulset -n kubeapps kubeapps-postgresql-master kubeapps-postgresql-slave
```

- https://helm.sh/docs/topics/v2_v3_migration/
- https://helm.sh/blog/migrate-from-helm-v2-to-helm-v3/

### Upgrading to 2.0

Kubeapps 2.0 (Chart version 4.0.0) introduces some breaking changes:

 - Helm 2 is no longer supported. If you are still using some Helm 2 charts, [migrate them with the available tools](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/v2_v3_migration/). Note that some charts (but not all of them) may require to be migrated to the [new Chart specification (v2)](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/#the-apiversion-field). If you are facing any issue managing this migration and Kubeapps, please open a new issue!
 - MongoDB&reg; is no longer supported. Since 2.0, the only database supported is PostgreSQL.
 - PostgreSQL chart dependency has been upgraded to a new major version.

Due to the last point, it's necessary to run a command before upgrading to Kubeapps 2.0:

> Note: The command below assumes that Kubeapps has been deployed in the kubeapps namespace using "kubeapps" as release name, if that's not the case, adapt the command accordingly.

```bash
kubectl delete statefulset -n kubeapps kubeapps-postgresql-master kubeapps-postgresql-slave
```

After that you should be able to upgrade Kubeapps as always and the database will be repopulated.
