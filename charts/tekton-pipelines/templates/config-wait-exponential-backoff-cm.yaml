# This ConfigMap allows cluster operators to configure the exponential backoff
# parameters used by Tekton Pipelines when retrying Kubernetes API operations,
# such as creating TaskRuns or CustomRuns. Adjusting these values can help
# tune retry behavior in response to webhook timeouts or transient errors.

  factor: "2.0" # The factor by which the duration increases after each retry (should not be negative).
  jitter: "0.0" # Jitter factor (0.0 = no jitter, 0.2 = up to 20% random additional wait).

  cap: "60s" # The maximum duration between retries (Go duration string, e.g. "30s").
