# feature flags to put in feature-flags ConfigMap
featureFlags:
  # Setting this flag to "true" will prevent Tekton to create an
  # Affinity Assistant for every TaskRun sharing a PVC workspace
  #
  # The default behaviour is for Tekton to create Affinity Assistants
  #
  # See more in the Affinity Assistant documentation
  # https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/main/docs/affinityassistants.md
  # or https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/pull/2630 for more info.
  #
  # Note: This feature flag is deprecated and will be removed in release v0.60. Consider using `coschedule` feature flag to configure Affinity Assistant behavior.
  disable-affinity-assistant: "false"
  # Setting this flag will determine how PipelineRun Pods are scheduled with Affinity Assistant.
  # Acceptable values are "workspaces" (default), "pipelineruns", "isolate-pipelinerun", or "disabled".
  #
  # Setting it to "workspaces" will schedule all the taskruns sharing the same PVC-based workspace in a pipelinerun to the same node.
  # Setting it to "pipelineruns" will schedule all the taskruns in a pipelinerun to the same node.
  # Setting it to "isolate-pipelinerun" will schedule all the taskruns in a pipelinerun to the same node,
  # and only allows one pipelinerun to run on a node at a time.
  # Setting it to "disabled" will not apply any coschedule policy.
  #
  # See more in the Affinity Assistant documentation
  # https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/main/docs/affinityassistants.md
  coschedule: "workspaces"
  # Setting this flag to "true" will prevent Tekton scanning attached
  # service accounts and injecting any credentials it finds into your
  # Steps.
  #
  # The default behaviour currently is for Tekton to search service
  # accounts for secrets matching a specified format and automatically
  # mount those into your Steps.
  #
  # Note: setting this to "true" will prevent PipelineResources from
  # working.
  #
  # See https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/issues/2791 for more
  # info.
  disable-creds-init: "false"
  # Setting this flag to "false" will stop Tekton from waiting for a
  # TaskRun's sidecar containers to be running before starting the first
  # step. This will allow Tasks to be run in environments that don't
  # support the DownwardAPI volume type, but may lead to unintended
  # behaviour if sidecars are used.
  #
  # See https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/issues/4937 for more info.
  await-sidecar-readiness: "true"
  # This option should be set to false when Pipelines is running in a
  # cluster that does not use injected sidecars such as Istio. Setting
  # it to false should decrease the time it takes for a TaskRun to start

  # This is an experimental feature and thus should still be considered an alpha feature.

  # max-result-size: "4096"
