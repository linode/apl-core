      Startup probes need to be configured to correctly manage a Pod's
      lifecycle during deployments, restarts, and upgrades. Sometimes, applications are temporarily unable to serve traffic. For example, an 
      application might need to load large data or configuration files during startup, or depend on external services after startup. 
      In such cases, you don't want to kill the application, but you don't want to send it requests either. 
      Kubernetes provides readiness probes to detect and mitigate these situations. 
      A pod with containers reporting that they are not ready does not receive traffic through Kubernetes Services. 
      This policy validates that all containers have a livenessProbe defined.
