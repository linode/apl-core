    policies.kyverno.io/description: >-
      Readiness probes need to be configured to correctly manage a Pod's
      lifecycle during deployments, restarts, and upgrades. A `readinessProbe` is used by Services
      and Deployments to determine if the Pod is ready to receive network traffic.
      This policy validates that all containers have a readinessProbe defined.
