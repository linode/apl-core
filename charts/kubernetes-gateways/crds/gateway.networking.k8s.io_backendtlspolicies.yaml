                  TargetRefs identifies an API object to apply the policy to.
                  Only Services have Extended support. Implementations MAY support
                  additional objects, with Implementation Specific support.
                  Note that this config applies to the entire referenced resource
                  by default, but this default may change in the future to provide
                  a more granular application of the policy.

                  TargetRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:

                  * They select different targets. If this is the case, then targetRef
                    entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the
                    multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, and `name` must
                    be unique across all targetRef entries in the BackendTLSPolicy.
                  * They select different sectionNames in the same target.

                  When more than one BackendTLSPolicy selects the same target and
                  sectionName, implementations MUST determine precedence using the
                  following criteria, continuing on ties:

                  * The older policy by creation timestamp takes precedence. For
                    example, a policy with a creation timestamp of "2021-07-15
                    01:02:03" MUST be given precedence over a policy with a
                    creation timestamp of "2021-07-15 01:02:04".
                  * The policy appearing first in alphabetical order by {name}.
                    For example, a policy named `bar` is given precedence over a
                    policy named `baz`.

                  For any BackendTLSPolicy that does not take precedence, the
                  implementation MUST ensure the `Accepted` Condition is set to
                  `status: False`, with Reason `Conflicted`.

                  Implementations SHOULD NOT support more than one targetRef at this
                  time. Although the API technically allows for this, the current guidance
                  for conflict resolution and status handling is lacking. Until that can be
                  clarified in a future release, the safest approach is to support a single
                  targetRef.

                      validate a TLS handshake between the Gateway and backend Pod.

                      If CACertificateRefs is empty or unspecified, then WellKnownCACertificates must be
                      specified. Only one of CACertificateRefs or WellKnownCACertificates may be specified,
                      not both. If CACertificateRefs is empty or unspecified, the configuration for
                      WellKnownCACertificates MUST be honored instead if supported by the implementation.

                      A CACertificateRef is invalid if:

                      * It refers to a resource that cannot be resolved (e.g., the referenced resource
                        does not exist) or is misconfigured (e.g., a ConfigMap does not contain a key
                        named `ca.crt`). In this case, the Reason must be set to `InvalidCACertificateRef`
                        and the Message of the Condition must indicate which reference is invalid and why.

                      * It refers to an unknown or unsupported kind of resource. In this case, the Reason
                        must be set to `InvalidKind` and the Message of the Condition must explain which
                        kind of resource is unknown or unsupported.

                      * It refers to a resource in another namespace. This may change in future
                        spec updates.

                      Implementations MAY choose to perform further validation of the certificate
                      content (e.g., checking expiry or enforcing specific formats). In such cases,
                      an implementation-specific Reason and Message must be set for the invalid reference.

                      In all cases, the implementation MUST ensure the `ResolvedRefs` Condition on
                      the BackendTLSPolicy is set to `status: False`, with a Reason and Message
                      that indicate the cause of the error. Connections using an invalid
                      CACertificateRef MUST fail, and the client MUST receive an HTTP 5xx error
                      response. If ALL CACertificateRefs are invalid, the implementation MUST also
                      ensure the `Accepted` Condition on the BackendTLSPolicy is set to
                      `status: False`, with a Reason `NoValidCACertificate`.

                      A single CACertificateRef to a Kubernetes ConfigMap kind has "Core" support.
                      Implementations MAY choose to support attaching multiple certificates to
                      a backend, but this behavior is implementation-specific.

                      with the CA certificate in a key named `ca.crt`.

                      of resources, or a single reference that includes multiple certificates.

              ancestors:
                description: |-
                  Ancestors is a list of ancestor resources (usually Gateways) that are
                  associated with the policy, and the status of the policy with respect to
                  each ancestor. When this policy attaches to a parent, the controller that
                  manages the parent and the ancestors MUST add an entry to this list when
                  the controller first sees the policy and SHOULD update the entry as
                  appropriate when the relevant ancestor is modified.

                  Note that choosing the relevant ancestor is left to the Policy designers;
                  an important part of Policy design is designing the right object level at
                  which to namespace this status.

                  Note also that implementations MUST ONLY populate ancestor status for
                  the Ancestor resources they are responsible for. Implementations MUST
                  use the ControllerName field to uniquely identify the entries in this list
                  that they are responsible for.

                  Note that to achieve this, the list of PolicyAncestorStatus structs
                  MUST be treated as a map with a composite key, made up of the AncestorRef
                  and ControllerName fields combined.

                  A maximum of 16 ancestors will be represented in this list. An empty list
                  means the Policy is not relevant for any ancestors.

                  If this slice is full, implementations MUST NOT add further entries.
                  Instead they MUST consider the policy unimplementable and signal that
                  on any related resources such as the ancestor that would be referenced
                  here. For example, if this list was full on BackendTLSPolicy, no
                  additional Gateways would be able to reference the Service targeted by
                  the BackendTLSPolicy.
                items:
                  description: |-
                    PolicyAncestorStatus describes the status of a route with respect to an
                    associated Ancestor.

                    Ancestors refer to objects that are either the Target of a policy or above it
                    in terms of object hierarchy. For example, if a policy targets a Service, the
                    Policy's Ancestors are, in order, the Service, the HTTPRoute, the Gateway, and
                    the GatewayClass. Almost always, in this hierarchy, the Gateway will be the most
                    useful object to place Policy status on, so we recommend that implementations
                    SHOULD use Gateway as the PolicyAncestorStatus object unless the designers
                    have a _very_ good reason otherwise.

                    In the context of policy attachment, the Ancestor is used to distinguish which
                    resource results in a distinct application of this policy. For example, if a policy
                    targets a Service, it may have a distinct result per attached Gateway.

                    Policies targeting the same resource may have different effects depending on the
                    ancestors of those resources. For example, different Gateways targeting the same
                    Service may have different capabilities, especially if they have different underlying
                    implementations.

                    For example, in BackendTLSPolicy, the Policy attaches to a Service that is
                    used as a backend in a HTTPRoute that is itself attached to a Gateway.
                    In this case, the relevant object for status is the Gateway, and that is the
                    ancestor object referred to in this status.

                    Note that a parent is also an ancestor, so for objects where the parent is the
                    relevant object for status, this struct SHOULD still be used.

                    This struct is intended to be used in a slice that's effectively a map,
                    with a composite key made up of the AncestorRef and the ControllerName.

                            allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example:
                            Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                            generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.

                            differently based on the type of parent resource.

                            When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners
                            listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and
                            select this Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the
                            networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
                            as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port
                            and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener
                            must match both specified values.

                            For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as
                            long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway
                            listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                            namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                            from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                            attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                            the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                  TargetRefs identifies an API object to apply the policy to.
                  Only Services have Extended support. Implementations MAY support
                  additional objects, with Implementation Specific support.
                  Note that this config applies to the entire referenced resource
                  by default, but this default may change in the future to provide
                  a more granular application of the policy.

                  TargetRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:

                  * They select different targets. If this is the case, then targetRef
                    entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the
                    multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, and `name` must
                    be unique across all targetRef entries in the BackendTLSPolicy.
                  * They select different sectionNames in the same target.

                  When more than one BackendTLSPolicy selects the same target and
                  sectionName, implementations MUST determine precedence using the
                  following criteria, continuing on ties:

                  * The older policy by creation timestamp takes precedence. For
                    example, a policy with a creation timestamp of "2021-07-15
                    01:02:03" MUST be given precedence over a policy with a
                    creation timestamp of "2021-07-15 01:02:04".
                  * The policy appearing first in alphabetical order by {name}.
                    For example, a policy named `bar` is given precedence over a
                    policy named `baz`.

                  For any BackendTLSPolicy that does not take precedence, the
                  implementation MUST ensure the `Accepted` Condition is set to
                  `status: False`, with Reason `Conflicted`.

                  Implementations SHOULD NOT support more than one targetRef at this
                  time. Although the API technically allows for this, the current guidance
                  for conflict resolution and status handling is lacking. Until that can be
                  clarified in a future release, the safest approach is to support a single
                  targetRef.

                      * It refers to an unknown or unsupported kind of resource. In this case, the Reason
                        must be set to `InvalidKind` and the Message of the Condition must explain which
                        kind of resource is unknown or unsupported.

                      * It refers to a resource in another namespace. This may change in future
                        spec updates.

                      Implementations MAY choose to perform further validation of the certificate
                      content (e.g., checking expiry or enforcing specific formats). In such cases,
                      an implementation-specific Reason and Message must be set for the invalid reference.

                      In all cases, the implementation MUST ensure the `ResolvedRefs` Condition on
                      the BackendTLSPolicy is set to `status: False`, with a Reason and Message
                      that indicate the cause of the error. Connections using an invalid
                      CACertificateRef MUST fail, and the client MUST receive an HTTP 5xx error
                      response. If ALL CACertificateRefs are invalid, the implementation MUST also
                      ensure the `Accepted` Condition on the BackendTLSPolicy is set to
                      `status: False`, with a Reason `NoValidCACertificate`.

                      A single CACertificateRef to a Kubernetes ConfigMap kind has "Core" support.
                      Implementations MAY choose to support attaching multiple certificates to
                      a backend, but this behavior is implementation-specific.

                      Support: Core - An optional single reference to a Kubernetes ConfigMap,
                      with the CA certificate in a key named `ca.crt`.

                      of resources, or a single reference that includes multiple certificates.

              ancestors:
                description: |-
                  Ancestors is a list of ancestor resources (usually Gateways) that are
                  associated with the policy, and the status of the policy with respect to
                  each ancestor. When this policy attaches to a parent, the controller that
                  manages the parent and the ancestors MUST add an entry to this list when
                  the controller first sees the policy and SHOULD update the entry as
                  appropriate when the relevant ancestor is modified.

                  Note that choosing the relevant ancestor is left to the Policy designers;
                  an important part of Policy design is designing the right object level at
                  which to namespace this status.

                  Note also that implementations MUST ONLY populate ancestor status for
                  the Ancestor resources they are responsible for. Implementations MUST
                  use the ControllerName field to uniquely identify the entries in this list
                  that they are responsible for.

                  Note that to achieve this, the list of PolicyAncestorStatus structs
                  MUST be treated as a map with a composite key, made up of the AncestorRef
                  and ControllerName fields combined.

                  A maximum of 16 ancestors will be represented in this list. An empty list
                  means the Policy is not relevant for any ancestors.

                  If this slice is full, implementations MUST NOT add further entries.
                  Instead they MUST consider the policy unimplementable and signal that
                  on any related resources such as the ancestor that would be referenced
                  here. For example, if this list was full on BackendTLSPolicy, no
                  additional Gateways would be able to reference the Service targeted by
                  the BackendTLSPolicy.
                items:
                  description: |-
                    PolicyAncestorStatus describes the status of a route with respect to an
                    associated Ancestor.

                    Ancestors refer to objects that are either the Target of a policy or above it
                    in terms of object hierarchy. For example, if a policy targets a Service, the
                    Policy's Ancestors are, in order, the Service, the HTTPRoute, the Gateway, and
                    the GatewayClass. Almost always, in this hierarchy, the Gateway will be the most
                    useful object to place Policy status on, so we recommend that implementations
                    SHOULD use Gateway as the PolicyAncestorStatus object unless the designers
                    have a _very_ good reason otherwise.

                    In the context of policy attachment, the Ancestor is used to distinguish which
                    resource results in a distinct application of this policy. For example, if a policy
                    targets a Service, it may have a distinct result per attached Gateway.

                    Policies targeting the same resource may have different effects depending on the
                    ancestors of those resources. For example, different Gateways targeting the same
                    Service may have different capabilities, especially if they have different underlying
                    implementations.

                    For example, in BackendTLSPolicy, the Policy attaches to a Service that is
                    used as a backend in a HTTPRoute that is itself attached to a Gateway.
                    In this case, the relevant object for status is the Gateway, and that is the
                    ancestor object referred to in this status.

                    Note that a parent is also an ancestor, so for objects where the parent is the
                    relevant object for status, this struct SHOULD still be used.

                    This struct is intended to be used in a slice that's effectively a map,
                    with a composite key made up of the AncestorRef and the ControllerName.

                            * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)

                            Support for other resources is Implementation-Specific.

                            Namespace is the namespace of the referent. When unspecified, this refers
                            to the local namespace of the Route.

                            Note that there are specific rules for ParentRefs which cross namespace
                            boundaries. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                            allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example:
                            Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                            generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.

                        port:
                          description: |-
                            Port is the network port this Route targets. It can be interpreted
                            differently based on the type of parent resource.

                            When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners
                            listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and
                            select this Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the
                            networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
                            as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port
                            and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener
                            must match both specified values.

                            Implementations MAY choose to support other parent resources.
                            Implementations supporting other types of parent resources MUST clearly
                            document how/if Port is interpreted.

                            For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as
                            long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway
                            listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                            namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                            from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                            attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                            the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                            SectionName is the name of a section within the target resource. In the
                            following resources, SectionName is interpreted as the following:

                            * Gateway: Listener name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                            are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
                            both specified values.
                            * Service: Port name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                            are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
                            both specified values.

                            Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.
                            If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is
                            interpreted.

                            When unspecified (empty string), this will reference the entire resource.
                            For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at
                            least one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example, Gateway
                            listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                            namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from
                            the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                            attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route, the
                            Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.
