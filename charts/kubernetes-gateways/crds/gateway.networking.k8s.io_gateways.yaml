                  Addresses requested for this Gateway. This is optional and behavior can
                  depend on the implementation. If a value is set in the spec and the
                  requested address is invalid or unavailable, the implementation MUST
                  indicate this in an associated entry in GatewayStatus.Conditions.

                  The Addresses field represents a request for the address(es) on the
                  "outside of the Gateway", that traffic bound for this Gateway will use.
                  This could be the IP address or hostname of an external load balancer or
                  other networking infrastructure, or some other address that traffic will
                  be sent to.

                  If no Addresses are specified, the implementation MAY schedule the
                  Gateway in an implementation-specific manner, assigning an appropriate
                  set of Addresses.

                  The implementation MUST bind all Listeners to every GatewayAddress that
                  it assigns to the Gateway and add a corresponding entry in
                  GatewayStatus.Addresses.

                  Listeners associated with this Gateway. Listeners define
                  logical endpoints that are bound on this Gateway's addresses.
                  At least one Listener MUST be specified.

                  ## Distinct Listeners

                  Each Listener in a set of Listeners (for example, in a single Gateway)
                  MUST be _distinct_, in that a traffic flow MUST be able to be assigned to
                  exactly one listener. (This section uses "set of Listeners" rather than
                  "Listeners in a single Gateway" because implementations MAY merge configuration
                  from multiple Gateways onto a single data plane, and these rules _also_
                  apply in that case).

                  Practically, this means that each listener in a set MUST have a unique
                  combination of Port, Protocol, and, if supported by the protocol, Hostname.

                  Some combinations of port, protocol, and TLS settings are considered
                  Core support and MUST be supported by implementations based on the objects
                  they support:

                  HTTPRoute

                  1. HTTPRoute, Port: 80, Protocol: HTTP
                  2. HTTPRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: HTTPS, TLS Mode: Terminate, TLS keypair provided

                  TLSRoute

                  1. TLSRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: TLS, TLS Mode: Passthrough

                  "Distinct" Listeners have the following property:

                  **The implementation can match inbound requests to a single distinct
                  Listener**.

                  When multiple Listeners share values for fields (for
                  example, two Listeners with the same Port value), the implementation
                  can match requests to only one of the Listeners using other
                  Listener fields.

                  When multiple listeners have the same value for the Protocol field, then
                  each of the Listeners with matching Protocol values MUST have different
                  values for other fields.

                  The set of fields that MUST be different for a Listener differs per protocol.
                  The following rules define the rules for what fields MUST be considered for
                  Listeners to be distinct with each protocol currently defined in the
                  Gateway API spec.

                  The set of listeners that all share a protocol value MUST have _different_
                  values for _at least one_ of these fields to be distinct:

                  * **HTTP, HTTPS, TLS**: Port, Hostname
                  * **TCP, UDP**: Port

                  One **very** important rule to call out involves what happens when an
                  implementation:

                  * Supports TCP protocol Listeners, as well as HTTP, HTTPS, or TLS protocol
                    Listeners, and
                  * sees HTTP, HTTPS, or TLS protocols with the same `port` as one with TCP
                    Protocol.

                  In this case all the Listeners that share a port with the
                  TCP Listener are not distinct and so MUST NOT be accepted.

                  If an implementation does not support TCP Protocol Listeners, then the
                  previous rule does not apply, and the TCP Listeners SHOULD NOT be
                  accepted.

                  Note that the `tls` field is not used for determining if a listener is distinct, because
                  Listeners that _only_ differ on TLS config will still conflict in all cases.

                  ### Listeners that are distinct only by Hostname

                  When the Listeners are distinct based only on Hostname, inbound request
                  hostnames MUST match from the most specific to least specific Hostname
                  values to choose the correct Listener and its associated set of Routes.

                  Exact matches MUST be processed before wildcard matches, and wildcard
                  matches MUST be processed before fallback (empty Hostname value)
                  matches. For example, `"foo.example.com"` takes precedence over
                  `"*.example.com"`, and `"*.example.com"` takes precedence over `""`.

                  Additionally, if there are multiple wildcard entries, more specific
                  wildcard entries must be processed before less specific wildcard entries.
                  For example, `"*.foo.example.com"` takes precedence over `"*.example.com"`.

                  The precise definition here is that the higher the number of dots in the
                  hostname to the right of the wildcard character, the higher the precedence.

                  The wildcard character will match any number of characters _and dots_ to
                  the left, however, so `"*.example.com"` will match both
                  `"foo.bar.example.com"` _and_ `"bar.example.com"`.

                  ## Handling indistinct Listeners

                  If a set of Listeners contains Listeners that are not distinct, then those
                  Listeners are _Conflicted_, and the implementation MUST set the "Conflicted"
                  condition in the Listener Status to "True".

                  The words "indistinct" and "conflicted" are considered equivalent for the
                  purpose of this documentation.

                  Implementations MAY choose to accept a Gateway with some Conflicted
                  Listeners only if they only accept the partial Listener set that contains
                  no Conflicted Listeners.

                  Specifically, an implementation MAY accept a partial Listener set subject to
                  the following rules:

                  * The implementation MUST NOT pick one conflicting Listener as the winner.
                    ALL indistinct Listeners must not be accepted for processing.
                  * At least one distinct Listener MUST be present, or else the Gateway effectively
                    contains _no_ Listeners, and must be rejected from processing as a whole.

                  The implementation MUST set a "ListenersNotValid" condition on the
                  Gateway Status when the Gateway contains Conflicted Listeners whether or
                  not they accept the Gateway. That Condition SHOULD clearly
                  indicate in the Message which Listeners are conflicted, and which are
                  Accepted. Additionally, the Listener status for those listeners SHOULD
                  indicate which Listeners are conflicted and not Accepted.

                  ## General Listener behavior

                  Note that, for all distinct Listeners, requests SHOULD match at most one Listener.
                  For example, if Listeners are defined for "foo.example.com" and "*.example.com", a
                  request to "foo.example.com" SHOULD only be routed using routes attached
                  to the "foo.example.com" Listener (and not the "*.example.com" Listener).

                  This concept is known as "Listener Isolation", and it is an Extended feature
                  of Gateway API. Implementations that do not support Listener Isolation MUST
                  clearly document this, and MUST NOT claim support for the
                  `GatewayHTTPListenerIsolation` feature.

                  Implementations that _do_ support Listener Isolation SHOULD claim support
                  for the Extended `GatewayHTTPListenerIsolation` feature and pass the associated
                  conformance tests.

                  ## Compatible Listeners

                  A Gateway's Listeners are considered _compatible_ if:

                  1. They are distinct.
                  2. The implementation can serve them in compliance with the Addresses
                     requirement that all Listeners are available on all assigned
                     addresses.

                  Compatible combinations in Extended support are expected to vary across
                  implementations. A combination that is compatible for one implementation
                  may not be compatible for another.

                  For example, an implementation that cannot serve both TCP and UDP listeners
                  on the same address, or cannot mix HTTPS and generic TLS listens on the same port
                  would not consider those cases compatible, even though they are distinct.

                  Implementations MAY merge separate Gateways onto a single set of
                  Addresses if all Listeners across all Gateways are compatible.

                  In a future release the MinItems=1 requirement MAY be dropped.

                        Although a client request may match multiple route rules, only one rule
                        may ultimately receive the request. Matching precedence MUST be
                        determined in order of the following criteria:

                        * The most specific match as defined by the Route type.
                        * The oldest Route based on creation timestamp. For example, a Route with
                          a creation timestamp of "2020-09-08 01:02:03" is given precedence over
                          a Route with a creation timestamp of "2020-09-08 01:02:04".
                        * If everything else is equivalent, the Route appearing first in
                          alphabetical order (namespace/name) should be given precedence. For
                          example, foo/bar is given precedence over foo/baz.

                        All valid rules within a Route attached to this Listener should be
                        implemented. Invalid Route rules can be ignored (sometimes that will mean
                        the full Route). If a Route rule transitions from valid to invalid,
                        support for that Route rule should be dropped to ensure consistency. For
                        example, even if a filter specified by a Route rule is invalid, the rest
                        of the rules within that Route should still be supported.

                        To ensure security, Section 11.1 of RFC-6066 emphasizes that server
                        implementations that rely on SNI hostname matching MUST also verify
                        hostnames within the application protocol.

                        Section 9.1.2 of RFC-7540 provides a mechanism for servers to reject the
                        reuse of a connection by responding with the HTTP 421 Misdirected Request
                        status code. This indicates that the origin server has rejected the
                        request because it appears to have been misdirected.

                        To detect misdirected requests, Gateways SHOULD match the authority of
                        the requests with all the SNI hostname(s) configured across all the
                        Gateway Listeners on the same port and protocol:

                        * If another Listener has an exact match or more specific wildcard entry,
                          the Gateway SHOULD return a 421.
                        * If the current Listener (selected by SNI matching during ClientHello)
                          does not match the Host:
                            * If another Listener does match the Host the Gateway SHOULD return a
                              421.
                            * If no other Listener matches the Host, the Gateway MUST return a
                              404.

                        For HTTPRoute and TLSRoute resources, there is an interaction with the
                        `spec.hostnames` array. When both listener and route specify hostnames,
                        there MUST be an intersection between the values for a Route to be
                        accepted. For more information, refer to the Route specific Hostnames
                        documentation.

                        Hostnames that are prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`) are interpreted
                        as a suffix match. That means that a match for `*.example.com` would match
                        both `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com`, but not `example.com`.

                        successfully attached to this Listener.

                        Successful attachment of a Route to a Listener is based solely on the
                        combination of the AllowedRoutes field on the corresponding Listener
                        and the Route's ParentRefs field. A Route is successfully attached to
                        a Listener when it is selected by the Listener's AllowedRoutes field
                        AND the Route has a valid ParentRef selecting the whole Gateway
                        resource or a specific Listener as a parent resource (more detail on
                        attachment semantics can be found in the documentation on the various
                        Route kinds ParentRefs fields). Listener or Route status does not impact
                        successful attachment, i.e. the AttachedRoutes field count MUST be set
                        for Listeners with condition Accepted: false and MUST count successfully
                        attached Routes that may themselves have Accepted: false conditions.

                        Uses for this field include troubleshooting Route attachment and
                        measuring blast radius/impact of changes to a Listener.

                  The Addresses field represents a request for the address(es) on the

                  This could be the IP address or hostname of an external load balancer or
                  other networking infrastructure, or some other address that traffic will
                  be sent to.

                  If no Addresses are specified, the implementation MAY schedule the
                  Gateway in an implementation-specific manner, assigning an appropriate
                  set of Addresses.

                  The implementation MUST bind all Listeners to every GatewayAddress that
                  it assigns to the Gateway and add a corresponding entry in
                  GatewayStatus.Addresses.

                  At least one Listener MUST be specified.

                  ## Distinct Listeners

                  Each Listener in a set of Listeners (for example, in a single Gateway)
                  MUST be _distinct_, in that a traffic flow MUST be able to be assigned to
                  exactly one listener. (This section uses "set of Listeners" rather than
                  "Listeners in a single Gateway" because implementations MAY merge configuration
                  from multiple Gateways onto a single data plane, and these rules _also_
                  apply in that case).

                  Practically, this means that each listener in a set MUST have a unique
                  combination of Port, Protocol, and, if supported by the protocol, Hostname.

                  Some combinations of port, protocol, and TLS settings are considered
                  Core support and MUST be supported by implementations based on the objects
                  they support:

                  HTTPRoute

                  1. HTTPRoute, Port: 80, Protocol: HTTP
                  2. HTTPRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: HTTPS, TLS Mode: Terminate, TLS keypair provided

                  TLSRoute

                  1. TLSRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: TLS, TLS Mode: Passthrough

                  "Distinct" Listeners have the following property:

                  **The implementation can match inbound requests to a single distinct
                  Listener**.

                  When multiple Listeners share values for fields (for
                  example, two Listeners with the same Port value), the implementation
                  can match requests to only one of the Listeners using other
                  Listener fields.

                  When multiple listeners have the same value for the Protocol field, then
                  each of the Listeners with matching Protocol values MUST have different
                  values for other fields.

                  The set of fields that MUST be different for a Listener differs per protocol.
                  The following rules define the rules for what fields MUST be considered for
                  Listeners to be distinct with each protocol currently defined in the
                  Gateway API spec.

                  The set of listeners that all share a protocol value MUST have _different_
                  values for _at least one_ of these fields to be distinct:

                  * **HTTP, HTTPS, TLS**: Port, Hostname
                  * **TCP, UDP**: Port

                  One **very** important rule to call out involves what happens when an
                  implementation:

                  * Supports TCP protocol Listeners, as well as HTTP, HTTPS, or TLS protocol
                    Listeners, and
                  * sees HTTP, HTTPS, or TLS protocols with the same `port` as one with TCP
                    Protocol.

                  In this case all the Listeners that share a port with the
                  TCP Listener are not distinct and so MUST NOT be accepted.

                  If an implementation does not support TCP Protocol Listeners, then the
                  previous rule does not apply, and the TCP Listeners SHOULD NOT be
                  accepted.

                  Note that the `tls` field is not used for determining if a listener is distinct, because
                  Listeners that _only_ differ on TLS config will still conflict in all cases.

                  ### Listeners that are distinct only by Hostname

                  When the Listeners are distinct based only on Hostname, inbound request
                  hostnames MUST match from the most specific to least specific Hostname
                  values to choose the correct Listener and its associated set of Routes.

                  Exact matches MUST be processed before wildcard matches, and wildcard
                  matches MUST be processed before fallback (empty Hostname value)
                  matches. For example, `"foo.example.com"` takes precedence over
                  `"*.example.com"`, and `"*.example.com"` takes precedence over `""`.

                  Additionally, if there are multiple wildcard entries, more specific
                  wildcard entries must be processed before less specific wildcard entries.
                  For example, `"*.foo.example.com"` takes precedence over `"*.example.com"`.

                  The precise definition here is that the higher the number of dots in the
                  hostname to the right of the wildcard character, the higher the precedence.

                  The wildcard character will match any number of characters _and dots_ to
                  the left, however, so `"*.example.com"` will match both
                  `"foo.bar.example.com"` _and_ `"bar.example.com"`.

                  ## Handling indistinct Listeners

                  If a set of Listeners contains Listeners that are not distinct, then those
                  Listeners are _Conflicted_, and the implementation MUST set the "Conflicted"
                  condition in the Listener Status to "True".

                  The words "indistinct" and "conflicted" are considered equivalent for the
                  purpose of this documentation.

                  Implementations MAY choose to accept a Gateway with some Conflicted
                  Listeners only if they only accept the partial Listener set that contains
                  no Conflicted Listeners.

                  Specifically, an implementation MAY accept a partial Listener set subject to
                  the following rules:

                  * The implementation MUST NOT pick one conflicting Listener as the winner.
                    ALL indistinct Listeners must not be accepted for processing.
                  * At least one distinct Listener MUST be present, or else the Gateway effectively
                    contains _no_ Listeners, and must be rejected from processing as a whole.

                  The implementation MUST set a "ListenersNotValid" condition on the
                  Gateway Status when the Gateway contains Conflicted Listeners whether or
                  not they accept the Gateway. That Condition SHOULD clearly
                  indicate in the Message which Listeners are conflicted, and which are
                  Accepted. Additionally, the Listener status for those listeners SHOULD
                  indicate which Listeners are conflicted and not Accepted.

                  ## General Listener behavior

                  Note that, for all distinct Listeners, requests SHOULD match at most one Listener.
                  For example, if Listeners are defined for "foo.example.com" and "*.example.com", a
                  request to "foo.example.com" SHOULD only be routed using routes attached
                  to the "foo.example.com" Listener (and not the "*.example.com" Listener).

                  This concept is known as "Listener Isolation", and it is an Extended feature
                  of Gateway API. Implementations that do not support Listener Isolation MUST
                  clearly document this, and MUST NOT claim support for the
                  `GatewayHTTPListenerIsolation` feature.

                  Implementations that _do_ support Listener Isolation SHOULD claim support
                  for the Extended `GatewayHTTPListenerIsolation` feature and pass the associated
                  conformance tests.

                  ## Compatible Listeners

                  A Gateway's Listeners are considered _compatible_ if:

                  1. They are distinct.
                  2. The implementation can serve them in compliance with the Addresses
                     requirement that all Listeners are available on all assigned
                     addresses.

                  Compatible combinations in Extended support are expected to vary across
                  implementations. A combination that is compatible for one implementation
                  may not be compatible for another.

                  For example, an implementation that cannot serve both TCP and UDP listeners
                  on the same address, or cannot mix HTTPS and generic TLS listens on the same port
                  would not consider those cases compatible, even though they are distinct.

                  Implementations MAY merge separate Gateways onto a single set of
                  Addresses if all Listeners across all Gateways are compatible.

                  In a future release the MinItems=1 requirement MAY be dropped.

                        Although a client request may match multiple route rules, only one rule
                        may ultimately receive the request. Matching precedence MUST be
                        determined in order of the following criteria:

                        * The most specific match as defined by the Route type.
                        * The oldest Route based on creation timestamp. For example, a Route with
                          a creation timestamp of "2020-09-08 01:02:03" is given precedence over
                          a Route with a creation timestamp of "2020-09-08 01:02:04".
                        * If everything else is equivalent, the Route appearing first in
                          alphabetical order (namespace/name) should be given precedence. For
                          example, foo/bar is given precedence over foo/baz.

                        All valid rules within a Route attached to this Listener should be
                        implemented. Invalid Route rules can be ignored (sometimes that will mean
                        the full Route). If a Route rule transitions from valid to invalid,
                        support for that Route rule should be dropped to ensure consistency. For
                        example, even if a filter specified by a Route rule is invalid, the rest
                        of the rules within that Route should still be supported.

                      description: |-
                        Hostname specifies the virtual hostname to match for protocol types that
                        define this concept. When unspecified, all hostnames are matched. This
                        field is ignored for protocols that don't require hostname based
                        matching.

                        Implementations MUST apply Hostname matching appropriately for each of
                        the following protocols:

                        * TLS: The Listener Hostname MUST match the SNI.
                        * HTTP: The Listener Hostname MUST match the Host header of the request.
                        * HTTPS: The Listener Hostname SHOULD match both the SNI and Host header.
                          Note that this does not require the SNI and Host header to be the same.
                          The semantics of this are described in more detail below.

                        To ensure security, Section 11.1 of RFC-6066 emphasizes that server
                        implementations that rely on SNI hostname matching MUST also verify
                        hostnames within the application protocol.

                        Section 9.1.2 of RFC-7540 provides a mechanism for servers to reject the
                        reuse of a connection by responding with the HTTP 421 Misdirected Request
                        status code. This indicates that the origin server has rejected the
                        request because it appears to have been misdirected.

                        To detect misdirected requests, Gateways SHOULD match the authority of
                        the requests with all the SNI hostname(s) configured across all the
                        Gateway Listeners on the same port and protocol:

                        * If another Listener has an exact match or more specific wildcard entry,
                          the Gateway SHOULD return a 421.
                        * If the current Listener (selected by SNI matching during ClientHello)
                          does not match the Host:
                            * If another Listener does match the Host the Gateway SHOULD return a
                              421.
                            * If no other Listener matches the Host, the Gateway MUST return a
                              404.

                        For HTTPRoute and TLSRoute resources, there is an interaction with the
                        `spec.hostnames` array. When both listener and route specify hostnames,
                        there MUST be an intersection between the values for a Route to be
                        accepted. For more information, refer to the Route specific Hostnames
                        documentation.

                        Hostnames that are prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`) are interpreted
                        as a suffix match. That means that a match for `*.example.com` would match
                        both `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com`, but not `example.com`.

                        Successful attachment of a Route to a Listener is based solely on the
                        combination of the AllowedRoutes field on the corresponding Listener
                        and the Route's ParentRefs field. A Route is successfully attached to
                        a Listener when it is selected by the Listener's AllowedRoutes field
                        AND the Route has a valid ParentRef selecting the whole Gateway
                        resource or a specific Listener as a parent resource (more detail on
                        attachment semantics can be found in the documentation on the various
                        Route kinds ParentRefs fields). Listener or Route status does not impact
                        successful attachment, i.e. the AttachedRoutes field count MUST be set
                        for Listeners with condition Accepted: false and MUST count successfully
                        attached Routes that may themselves have Accepted: false conditions.

                        Uses for this field include troubleshooting Route attachment and
                        measuring blast radius/impact of changes to a Listener.

                        listener. This MUST represent the kinds an implementation supports for
                        that Listener configuration.

                        If kinds are specified in Spec that are not supported, they MUST NOT
                        appear in this list and an implementation MUST set the "ResolvedRefs"
                        condition to "False" with the "InvalidRouteKinds" reason. If both valid
                        and invalid Route kinds are specified, the implementation MUST
                        reference the valid Route kinds that have been specified.
