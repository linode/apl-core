# Argo CD Chart

A Helm chart for Argo CD, a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes.

Source code can be found here:

* <https://github.com/argoproj/argo-helm/tree/main/charts/argo-cd>
* <https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd>

This is a **community maintained** chart. This chart installs [argo-cd](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes.

The default installation is intended to be similar to the provided Argo CD [releases](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases).

If you want to avoid including sensitive information unencrypted (clear text) in your version control, make use of the [declarative setup] of Argo CD.
For instance, rather than adding repositories and their keys in your Helm values, you could deploy [SealedSecrets](https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets) with contents as seen in this [repositories section](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/declarative-setup/#repositories) or any other secrets manager service (i.e. HashiCorp Vault, AWS/GCP Secrets Manager, etc.).

## High Availability

This chart installs the non-HA version of Argo CD by default. If you want to run Argo CD in HA mode, you can use one of the example values in the next sections.
Please also have a look into the upstream [Operator Manual regarding High Availability](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/high_availability/) to understand how scaling of Argo CD works in detail.

> **Warning:**
> You need at least 3 worker nodes as the HA mode of redis enforces Pods to run on separate nodes.

### HA mode with autoscaling

```yaml
redis-ha:
  enabled: true

controller:
  replicas: 1

server:
  autoscaling:
    enabled: true
    minReplicas: 2

repoServer:
  autoscaling:
    enabled: true
    minReplicas: 2

applicationSet:
  replicaCount: 2
```

### HA mode without autoscaling

```yaml
redis-ha:
  enabled: true

controller:
  replicas: 1

server:
  replicas: 2

repoServer:
  replicas: 2

applicationSet:
  replicaCount: 2
```

### Synchronizing Changes from Original Repository

In the original [Argo CD repository](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/) an [`manifests/install.yaml`](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/blob/master/manifests/install.yaml) is generated using `kustomize`. It's the basis for the installation as [described in the docs](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/#1-install-argo-cd).

When installing Argo CD using this helm chart the user should have a similar experience and configuration rolled out. Hence, it makes sense to try to achieve a similar output of rendered `.yaml` resources when calling `helm template` using the default settings in `values.yaml`.

To update the templates and default settings in `values.yaml` it may come in handy to look up the diff of the `manifests/install.yaml` between two versions accordingly. This can either be done directly via github and look for `manifests/install.yaml`:

https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/compare/v1.8.7...v2.0.0#files_bucket

Or you clone the repository and do a local `git-diff`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd.git
cd argo-cd
git diff v1.8.7 v2.0.0 -- manifests/install.yaml
```

Changes in the `CustomResourceDefinition` resources shall be fixed easily by copying 1:1 from the [`manifests/crds` folder](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/tree/master/manifests/crds) into this [`charts/argo-cd/templates/crds` folder](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-helm/tree/master/charts/argo-cd/templates/crds).

### Custom resource definitions

Some users would prefer to install the CRDs _outside_ of the chart. You can disable the CRD installation of this chart by using `--set crds.install=false` when installing the chart.

Helm cannot upgrade custom resource definitions in the `<chart>/crds` folder [by design](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_best_practices/custom_resource_definitions/#some-caveats-and-explanations). Starting with 5.2.0, the CRDs have been moved to `<chart>/templates` to address this design decision.

If you are using Argo CD chart version prior to 5.2.0 or have elected to manage the Argo CD CRDs outside of the chart, please use `kubectl` to upgrade CRDs manually from [templates/crds](templates/crds/) folder or via the manifests from the upstream project repo:

```bash
kubectl apply -k "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/manifests/crds?ref=<appVersion>"

# Eg. version v2.4.9
kubectl apply -k "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/manifests/crds?ref=v2.4.9"
```

## Changelog

For full list of changes please check ArtifactHub [changelog].

Highlighted versions provide information about additional steps that should be performed by user when upgrading to newer version.

### 5.13.0

This version reduces history limit for Argo CD deployment replicas to 3 to provide more visibility for Argo CD deployments that manage itself. If you need more deployment revisions for rollbacks set `global.revisionHistoryLimit` parameter.

### 5.12.0

This version deprecates the `configs.secret.argocdServerTlsConfig` option. Use `server.certificate` or `server.certificateSecret` to provide custom TLS configuration for Argo CD server.
If you terminate TLS on ingress please use `argocd-server-tls` secret instead of `argocd-secret` secret.

### 5.10.0

This version hardens security by configuring default container security contexts and adds hard requirement for Kubernetes 1.22+ to work properly.
The change aligns chart with officially [supported versions](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.5/operator-manual/installation/#supported-versions) by upstream project.

### 5.7.0

This version introcudes new `configs.cm` and `configs.rbac` sections that replaces `server.config` and `server.rbacConfig` respectively.
Please move your current configuration to the new place. The Argo CD RBAC config now also sets defaults in the `argocd-rbac-cm`.
If you have manually created this ConfigMap please ensure templating is disabled so you will not lose your changes.

### 5.5.20

This version moved API version templates into dedicated helper. If you are using these in your umbrella
chart please migrate your templates to pattern `argo-cd.apiVersion.<component>`.

### 5.5.0

This version introduces new `configs.params` section that replaces command line arguments for containers.
Please refer to documentation in values.yaml for migrating the configuration.

### 5.2.0

Custom resource definitions were moved to `templates` folder so they can be managed by Helm.

To adopt already created CRDs, please use following command:

```bash
YOUR_ARGOCD_NAMESPACE="" # e.g. argo-cd
YOUR_ARGOCD_RELEASENAME="" # e.g. argo-cd

for crd in "applications.argoproj.io" "applicationsets.argoproj.io" "argocdextensions.argoproj.io" "appprojects.argoproj.io"; do
  kubectl label --overwrite crd $crd app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=Helm
  kubectl annotate --overwrite crd $crd meta.helm.sh/release-namespace="$YOUR_ARGOCD_NAMESPACE"
  kubectl annotate --overwrite crd $crd meta.helm.sh/release-name="$YOUR_ARGOCD_RELEASENAME"
done
```

### 5.0.0

This version **removes support for**:

- deprecated repository credentials (parameter `configs.repositoryCredentials`)
- option to run application controller as a Deployment
- the parameters `server.additionalApplications` and `server.additionalProjects`

Please carefully read the following section if you are using these parameters!

In order to upgrade Applications and Projects safely against CRDs' upgrade, `server.additionalApplications` and `server.additionalProjects` are moved to [argocd-apps](../argocd-apps).

If you are using `server.additionalApplications` or `server.additionalProjects`, you can adopt to [argocd-apps](../argocd-apps) as below:

1. Add [helm.sh/resource-policy annotation](https://helm.sh/docs/howto/charts_tips_and_tricks/#tell-helm-not-to-uninstall-a-resource) to avoid resources being removed by upgrading Helm chart

You can keep your existing CRDs by adding `"helm.sh/resource-policy": keep` on `additionalAnnotations`, under `server.additionalApplications` and `server.additionalProjects` blocks, and running `helm upgrade`.

e.g:

```yaml
server:
  additionalApplications:
    - name: guestbook
      namespace: argocd
      additionalLabels: {}
      additionalAnnotations:
        "helm.sh/resource-policy": keep # <-- add this
      finalizers:
      - resources-finalizer.argocd.argoproj.io
      project: guestbook
      source:
        repoURL: https://github.com/argoproj/argocd-example-apps.git
        targetRevision: HEAD
        path: guestbook
        directory:
          recurse: true
      destination:
        server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
        namespace: guestbook
      syncPolicy:
        automated:
          prune: false
          selfHeal: false
      ignoreDifferences:
      - group: apps
        kind: Deployment
        jsonPointers:
        - /spec/replicas
      info:
      - name: url
        value: https://argoproj.github.io/
```

You can also keep your existing CRDs by running the following scripts.

```bash
# keep Applications
for app in "guestbook"; do
  kubectl annotate --overwrite application $app helm.sh/resource-policy=keep
done

# keep Projects
for project in "guestbook"; do
  kubectl annotate --overwrite appproject $project helm.sh/resource-policy=keep
done
```

2. Upgrade argo-cd Helm chart to v5.0.0

3. Remove keep [helm.sh/resource-policy annotation](https://helm.sh/docs/howto/charts_tips_and_tricks/#tell-helm-not-to-uninstall-a-resource)

```bash
# delete annotations from Applications
for app in "guestbook"; do
  kubectl annotate --overwrite application $app helm.sh/resource-policy-
done

# delete annotations from Projects
for project in "guestbook"; do
  kubectl annotate --overwrite appproject $project helm.sh/resource-policy-
done
```

4. Adopt existing resources to [argocd-apps](../argocd-apps)

### 4.9.0

This version starts to use upstream image with applicationset binary. Start command was changed from `applicationset-controller` to `argocd-applicationset-controller`

### 4.3.*

With this minor version, the notification notifier's `service.slack` is no longer configured by default.

### 4.0.0 and above

This helm chart version deploys Argo CD v2.3. The Argo CD Notifications and ApplicationSet are part of Argo CD now. You no longer need to install them separately. The Notifications and ApplicationSet components **are bundled into default** Argo CD installation.
Please read the [v2.2 to 2.3 upgrade instructions] in the upstream repository.

### 3.13.0

This release removes the flag `--staticassets` from argocd server as it has been dropped upstream. If this flag needs to be enabled e.g for older releases of Argo CD, it can be passed via the `server.extraArgs` field

### 3.10.2

Argo CD has recently deprecated the flag `--staticassets` and from chart version `3.10.2` has been disabled by default
It can be re-enabled by setting `server.staticAssets.enabled` to true

### 3.8.1

This bugfix version potentially introduces a rename (and recreation) of one or more ServiceAccounts. It _only happens_ when you use one of these customization:

```yaml
# Case 1) - only happens when you do not specify a custom name (repoServer.serviceAccount.name)
repoServer:
  serviceAccount:
    create: true

# Case 2)
controller:
  serviceAccount:
    name: "" # or <nil>

# Case 3)
dex:
  serviceAccount:
    name: "" # or <nil>

# Case 4)
server:
  serviceAccount:
    name: "" # or <nil>
```

Please check if you are affected by one of these cases **before you upgrade**, especially when you use **cloud IAM roles for service accounts.** (eg. IRSA on AWS or Workload Identity for GKE)

### 3.2.*

With this minor version we introduced the evaluation for the ingress manifest (depending on the capabilities version), See [Pull Request](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-helm/pull/637).
[Issue 703](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-helm/issues/703) reported that the capabilities evaluation is **not handled correctly when deploying the chart via an Argo CD instance**,
especially deploying on clusters running a cluster version prior to `1.19` (which misses  `Ingress` on apiVersion `networking.k8s.io/v1`).

If you are running a cluster version prior to `1.19` you can avoid this issue by directly installing chart version `3.6.0` and setting `kubeVersionOverride` like:

```yaml
kubeVersionOverride: "1.18.0"
```

Then you should no longer encounter this issue.

### 3.0.0 and above

Helm apiVersion switched to `v2`. Requires Helm `3.0.0` or above to install. [Read More](https://helm.sh/blog/migrate-from-helm-v2-to-helm-v3/) on how to migrate your release from Helm 2 to Helm 3.

### 2.14.7 and above

The `matchLabels` key in the Argo CD Application Controller is no longer hard-coded. Note that labels are immutable so caution should be exercised when making changes to this resource.

### 2.10.x to 2.11.0

The application controller is now available as a `StatefulSet` when the `controller.enableStatefulSet` flag is set to true. Depending on your Helm deployment this may be a downtime or breaking change if enabled when using HA and will become the default in 3.x.

### 1.8.7 to 2.x.x

`controller.extraArgs`, `repoServer.extraArgs` and `server.extraArgs`  are now arrays of strings instead of a map

What was

```yaml
server:
  extraArgs:
    insecure: ""
```

is now

```yaml
server:
  extraArgs:
  - --insecure
```

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes: `>=1.22.0-0`
- Helm v3.0.0+

### Using AWS ALB Ingress Controller With GRPC

If you are using an AWS ALB Ingress controller, you will need to set `server.ingressGrpc.isAWSALB` to `true`. This will create a second service with the annotation `alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol-version: HTTP2` and modify the server ingress to add a condition annotation to route GRPC traffic to the new service.

Example:

```yaml
server:
  ingress:
    enabled: true
    annotations:
      alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: HTTPS
      alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/listen-ports: '[{"HTTPS":443}]'
      alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/scheme: internal
      alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/target-type: ip
  ingressGrpc:
    enabled: true
    isAWSALB: true
    awsALB:
      serviceType: ClusterIP
```
