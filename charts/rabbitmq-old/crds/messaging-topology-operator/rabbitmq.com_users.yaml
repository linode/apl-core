                  Defines a Secret used to pre-define the username and password set for this User. User objects created
                  with this field set will not have randomly-generated credentials, and will instead import
                  the username/password values from this Secret.
                  The Secret must contain the keys `username` and `password` in its Data field, or the import will fail.
                  Note that this import only occurs at creation time, and is ignored once a password has been set
                  on a User.
