# feature flags to put in feature-flags ConfigMap
featureFlags:
  # Setting this flag to "true" will prevent Tekton to create an
  # Affinity Assistant for every TaskRun sharing a PVC workspace
  #
  # The default behaviour is for Tekton to create Affinity Assistants
  #
  # See more in the workspace documentation about Affinity Assistant
  # https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/main/docs/workspaces.md#affinity-assistant-and-specifying-workspace-order-in-a-pipeline
  # or https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/pull/2630 for more info.
  disable-affinity-assistant: "false"
  # Setting this flag to "true" will prevent Tekton scanning attached
  # service accounts and injecting any credentials it finds into your
  # Steps.
  #
  # The default behaviour currently is for Tekton to search service
  # accounts for secrets matching a specified format and automatically
  # mount those into your Steps.
  #
  # Note: setting this to "true" will prevent PipelineResources from
  # working.
  #
  # See https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/issues/2791 for more
  # info.
  disable-creds-init: "false"
  # Setting this flag to "false" will stop Tekton from waiting for a
  # TaskRun's sidecar containers to be running before starting the first
  # step. This will allow Tasks to be run in environments that don't
  # support the DownwardAPI volume type, but may lead to unintended
  # behaviour if sidecars are used.
  #
  # See https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/issues/4937 for more info.
  await-sidecar-readiness: "true"
  # This option should be set to false when Pipelines is running in a
  # cluster that does not use injected sidecars such as Istio. Setting
  # it to false should decrease the time it takes for a TaskRun to start
  # running. For clusters that use injected sidecars, setting this
  # option to false can lead to unexpected behavior.
  #
  # See https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/issues/2080 for more info.
  running-in-environment-with-injected-sidecars: "true"
  # Setting this flag to "true" will require that any Git SSH Secret

  # info.
