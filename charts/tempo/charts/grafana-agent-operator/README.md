A Helm chart for Grafana Agent Operator

⚠️  **Please create issues relating to this Helm chart in the [Agent](https://github.com/grafana/agent/issues) repo.**

## Source Code

* <https://github.com/grafana/agent/tree/v0.43.3/static/operator>

Note that this chart does not provision custom resources like `GrafanaAgent` and `MetricsInstance` (formerly `PrometheusInstance`) or any `*Monitor` resources.

To learn how to deploy these resources, please see Grafana's [Agent Operator getting started guide](https://grafana.com/docs/agent/latest/operator/getting-started/).

## CRDs

The CRDs are synced into this chart manually (for now) from the Grafana Agent [GitHub repo](https://github.com/grafana/agent/tree/main/operations/agent-static-operator/crds). To learn more about how Helm manages CRDs, please see [Custom Resource Definitions](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_best_practices/custom_resource_definitions/) from the Helm docs.

## Get Repo Info

```console
helm repo add grafana https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
```

_See [helm repo](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_repo/) for command documentation._

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```console
helm install my-release grafana/grafana-agent-operator
```

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the my-release deployment:

```console
helm delete my-release
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

## Upgrading an existing Release to a new major version

A major chart version change (like v1.2.3 -> v2.0.0) indicates that there is an incompatible breaking change needing manual actions. Until this chart's version reaches `v1.0`, there are no promises of backwards compatibility.
