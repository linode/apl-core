# falco-exporter Helm Chart

[falco-exporter](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco-exporter) is a Prometheus Metrics Exporter for Falco output events.

Before using this chart, you need [Falco installed](https://falco.org/docs/installation/) and running with the [gRPC Output](https://falco.org/docs/grpc/) enabled (over Unix socket by default).

This chart is compatible with the [Falco Chart](https://github.com/falcosecurity/charts/tree/master/charts/falco) version `v1.2.0` or greater. Instructions to enable the gRPC Output in the Falco Helm Chart can be found [here](https://github.com/falcosecurity/charts/tree/master/charts/falco#enabling-grpc). We also strongly recommend using [gRPC over Unix socket](https://github.com/falcosecurity/charts/tree/master/charts/falco#grpc-over-unix-socket-default).

## Introduction

The chart deploys **falco-exporter** as Daemon Set on your the Kubernetes cluster. If a [Prometheus installation](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/prometheus) is running within your cluster, metrics provided by **falco-exporter** will be automatically discovered.

## Adding `falcosecurity` repository

Prior to installing the chart, add the `falcosecurity` charts repository:

```bash
helm repo add falcosecurity https://falcosecurity.github.io/charts
helm repo update
```

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `falco-exporter` run:

```bash
helm install falco-exporter falcosecurity/falco-exporter
```

After a few seconds, **falco-exporter** should be running.

> **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`, a release is a name used to track a specific deployment

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall the `falco-exporter` deployment:

```bash
helm uninstall falco-exporter
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

```bash
helm install falco-exporter --set falco.grpcTimeout=3m falcosecurity/falco-exporter
```

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the parameters' values can be provided while installing the chart. For example,

```bash
helm install falco-exporter -f values.yaml falcosecurity/falco-exporter
```

### Enable Mutual TLS

Mutual TLS for `/metrics` endpoint can be enabled to prevent alerts content from being consumed by unauthorized components.

To install falco-exporter with Mutual TLS enabled, you have to:

```shell
helm install falco-exporter \
  --set service.mTLS.enabled=true \
  --set-file service.mTLS.server.key=/path/to/server.key \
  --set-file service.mTLS.server.crt=/path/to/server.crt \
  --set-file service.mTLS.ca.crt=/path/to/ca.crt \
  falcosecurity/falco-exporter
```

> **Tip**: You can use the default [values.yaml](values.yaml)
