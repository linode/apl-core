Otomi turns any Kubernetes cluster into a DevOps Platform to provide paved roads from code to production
</h4>

## How Otomi helps

**DevSecOps Teams** - With self-service, automation and visibility to let them take full-service ownership

- Scan source code for vulnerabilities
- Build OCI compliant images from application code and store them in a private registry
- Deploy containerized workloads using a catalog with pre-filled golden path templates
- Automatically update container images of workloads
- Publicly expose applications
- Get instant access to logs, metrics and traces, vulnerabilities, threads and policy violations
- Configure network policies, response headers and CNAMEs
- Manage secrets

**Platform teams** - To setup a Kubernetes-based platform for DevOps teams and provide them a paved road to production

- Create a platform profile and deploy to any Kubernetes cluster
- Onboard DevSecOps teams in a comprehensive multi-tenant setup and allow them to take full ownership over their applications
- Get all the required capabilities in an integrated and automated way
- Ensure governance with security policies
- Implement zero-trust networking
- Change the desired state of the platform based on Configuration-as-Code
- Support multi- and hybrid cloud scenarios
- Prevent cloud provider lock-in
- Implement full observability (metrics, logs, traces, alerts)
- Create Golden path templates and offer them to teams on the platform through a catalog

## Getting started

### Helm

To install Otomi, make sure to have a K8s cluster running with at least:

- Version `1.25`, `1.26` or `1.27`
- A node pool with at least **8 vCPU** and **16GB+ RAM** (more resources might be required based on the activated capabilities)
- Calico CNI installed (or any other CNI that supports K8s network policies)
- A default storage class configured
- When using the `custom` provider, make sure the K8s LoadBalancer Service created by `Otomi` can obtain an external IP (using a cloud load balancer or MetalLB)

> **_NOTE:_**  Install Otomi with DNS to unlock it's full potential. Check [otomi.io](https://otomi.io) for more info.

Add the Helm repository:

```bash
helm repo add otomi https://otomi.io/otomi-core
helm repo update
```

and then install the Helm chart:

```bash
helm install otomi otomi/otomi \
--set cluster.name=$CLUSTERNAME \
--set cluster.provider=$PROVIDER # use 'azure', 'aws', 'google', 'digitalocean', 'ovh', 'vultr', 'scaleway', 'civo', 'linode', or 'custom' for any other cloud or onprem infrastructure
```

When the installer job is completed, follow the [activation steps](https://otomi.io/docs/get-started/activation).

## Platform architecture

Otomi consists out of the following components:

### Self-service portal and Cloud Shell

The `otomi-console` self-service portal offers a seamless user experience for DevSecOps teams and platform administrators. Platform administrators can use Otomi Console to enable and configure platform capabilities and onboard development teams. DevOps teams can use Otomi Console to build images, deploy and expose Workloads, configure CNAMEs, configure network policies and manage secrets. Otomi Console also provides context aware access to platform capabilities like code repositories, registries, logs, metrics, traces, dashboards, etc. Next to the web based self-service, both teams and admins can start a Cloud Shell and run CLI commands.

### Platform Control plane

All changes made through the Console are validated by the platform control plane (`otomi-api`) and then committed as code in Git. This will automatically trigger the platform to synchronize the desired state to the Kubernetes state of the platform based on GitOps.

### Pre-filled Catalog

A Catalog with reusable templates to create workloads. The Catalog is pre-filled with a set of templates maintained in the `otomi/charts` repo. You can also add your own charts and offer them to the teams on the platform.

### Automation

The automation (a set of Kubernetes operators) is used to synchronize the desired state to the state of applications like Keycloak, Harbor and Gitea.

### Capabilities

Otomi offers a set of integrated Kubernetes applications (using upstream open source projects) for all the required platform capabilities. Core applications are always installed, optional applications can be activated on-demand. When an application is activated, the application will be installed based on a configuration profile that contains defaults, best-practices and platform integrations. Default configuration can be adjusted using the Console.
