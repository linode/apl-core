## Quick start

### Terraform

Use the Terraform quick start for Azure, GCP, and AWS to provision a Kubernetes cluster in your cloud of choice and install Otomi with minimal values. Go to the [quickstart repository](https://github.com/redkubes/quickstart) to get started.

When the installer job (in the default namespace) has finished, copy the URL and the generated password from the bottom of the logs of the job and complete the [post-installation steps](https://otomi.io/docs/installation/post-install/).

### Helm Chart

To install `Otomi` with minimal values using the Helm chart, first create a `values.yaml` file with the following values:

```yaml
cluster:
  k8sVersion: '1.21' # currently 1.18, 1.19, 1.20 and 1.21 are supported
  name: # the name of your cluster
  provider: # choose between aws, azure, google or onprem
```

add the Helm repository:

```bash
helm repo add otomi https://otomi.io/otomi-core
helm repo update
```

and then install the Helm chart:

```bash
helm install -f values.yaml otomi otomi/otomi
```

When the installer job (in the default namespace) has finished, copy the URL and the generated password from the bottom of the logs and complete the [post-installation steps](https://otomi.io/docs/installation/post-install/).

After installing `Otomi`, you can use [Otomi Console](https://otomi.io/docs/console/) to access all integrated applications and self-service features.
