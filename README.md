## About Otomi

Otomi is the first and only Kubernetes-based Operating System. Use Otomi to built your Internal Developer Platform (IDP) or Enterprise-grade Container Platform.

Otomi is **free**, **easy to install**, comes with an **intuitive UI** and ready to use **built-in applications** and offers an **out-of-the-box experience**. Just like you would expect from your favorite Linux distribution. After installing Otomi on Kubernetes, you can log in and start deploying and managing your containerized applications and use all built-in applications. Get started at [otomi.io](https://otomi.io/).

Otomi includes:

- Developer self-service, hiding the Kubernetes internals
- Pre-configured and ready to use applications like Harbor, Prometheus, Grafana Loki, HashiCorp Vault, Open Policy Agent, Keycloak, Jaeger, Kiali and more
- Application configuration management for all integrated applications: Providing a base profile configuration to support the most common use-cases
- Multi-tenancy: Create teams and provide SSO access to teams and shared applications
- Implemented policies for better governance and security. Manifests are checked both statically and on the cluster at runtime for policy obedience
- Single Sign On: Bring your own IDP
- Automatic ingress configuration: Easily configure ingress for Team services or core apps, allowing access within minutes. Istio gateways and virtual services are automatically generated and configured for Team services, tying a generic ingress architecture to service endpoints in a predictable way
- Input/output validation: Configuration and output manifests are checked statically for validity and best practices
- Automatic vulnerability scanning: Scan all configured Team service containers in Harbor
- Build in support for Azure, Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform

Otomi aims to support the most common DevOps use cases out-of-the-box and strongly relies on GitOps patterns, where desired state is reflected as code and the cluster state is automatically updated.

Otomi consists out of multiple projects:

- Otomi Core (this project): The heart of Otomi
- [Otomi Tasks](https://github.com/redkubes/otomi-tasks): Autonomous jobs orchestrated by Otomi Core
- [Otomi API](https://github.com/redkubes/otomi-api): The brain of Otomi, handling console input and talking to Otomi Core
- [Otomi Console](https://github.com/redkubes/otomi-console): The UI of Otomi for admins and teams, talking to Otomi API
- [Otomi Clients](https://github.com/redkubes/otomi-clients): Factory to build and publish openapi clients used in the redkubes/otomi-tasks repo
