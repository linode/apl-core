`Otomi` brings a full platform experience to Kubernetes without the constraints and abstractions. No more reinventing the wheel when building and maintaining your own K8s based (developer) platform.

![Otomi features](https://github.com/redkubes/otomi-core/blob/main/docs/img/otomi-features.gif)

## üöÄ Getting started

### Helm

To install `Otomi` using Helm, make sure to have a K8s cluster running with at least:

- Version `1.18` up to `1.23`
- A node pool with **6 vCPU** and **8GB+ RAM** (more is advised!)
- Calico CNI installed (or any other CNI that supports K8s network policies)
- When installing using the `custom` provider, make sure the K8s LoadBalancer Service created by `Otomi` can obtain an external accessible IP (using a cloud load balancer or MetalLB)

Add the Helm repository:

```bash
helm repo add otomi https://otomi.io/otomi-core \
helm repo update
```

and then install the Helm chart:

```bash
helm install otomi otomi/otomi \
--set cluster.k8sVersion=$VERSION \ # 1.19, 1.20, 1.21, 1.22 and 1.23 are supported
--set cluster.name=$CLUSTERNAME \
--set cluster.provider=$PROVIDER # use azure, aws, google, digitalocean or custom for any other cloud or onprem K8s
```

When the installer job is completed, follow the [activation steps](https://otomi.io/docs/installation/activation/).

### K8s quick starts

Use the [quickstarts](https://github.com/redkubes/quickstart) for Azure, GCP, AWS, Linode, Digital Ocean and Minikube to provision a Kubernetes cluster. Then use the helm chart to install `Otomi`.

### Workshops

In our [workshops](https://github.com/redkubes/workshops) repository, we have prepared a comprehensive set of hands-on labs to get a good understanding/overview of Otomi.
