## Otomi helps

**Developers** - With easy self-service to let them focus on their apps only

- Build OCI compliant images from application code
- Deploy containerized workloads the GitOps way using build-in or custom golden path templates
- Automatically update container images of workloads
- Publicly expose applications
- Get instant access to logs, metrics and traces
- Store charts and images in a private registry
- Configure network policies, response headers and CNAMEs
- Manage secrets
- Create private Git repositories and custom pipelines

**Platform engineers** - To setup a Kubernetes-based platform and provide a paved road to production

- Create your platform profile and deploy to any K8s
- Onboard development teams in a comprehensive multi-tenant setup and make them self-serving
- Get all the required capabilities in an integrated and automated way
- Ensure governance with security policies
- Implement zero-trust networking
- Change the desired state of the platform based on Configuration-as-Code
- Support multi- and hybrid cloud scenarios
- Prevent cloud provider lock-in
- Implement full observability

## Getting started

### Helm

To install Otomi, make sure to have a K8s cluster running with at least:

- Version `1.25`, `1.26` or `1.27`
- A node pool with at least **8 vCPU** and **16GB+ RAM** (more resources might be required based on the activated capabilities)
- Calico CNI installed (or any other CNI that supports K8s network policies)
- A default storage class configured
- When using the `custom` provider, make sure the K8s LoadBalancer Service created by `Otomi` can obtain an external IP (using a cloud load balancer or MetalLB)

> **_NOTE:_**  Install Otomi with DNS to unlock it's full potential. Check [otomi.io](https://otomi.io) for more info.

Add the Helm repository:

```bash
helm repo add otomi https://otomi.io/otomi-core
helm repo update
```

and then install the Helm chart:

```bash
helm install otomi otomi/otomi \
--set cluster.name=$CLUSTERNAME \
--set cluster.provider=$PROVIDER # use 'azure', 'aws', 'google', 'digitalocean', 'ovh', 'vultr', 'scaleway', 'civo', or 'custom' for any other cloud or onprem K8s
```

When the installer job is completed, follow the [activation steps](https://otomi.io/docs/get-started/activation).

## Platform architecture

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/redkubes/otomi-core/blob/main/docs/img/otomi-platform.png/?raw=true" width="100%" align="center" alt="Otomi platform"></p>

### Self-service portal and CLI

The self-service portal (Otomi Console) offers seamless user experience for developers and platform administrators. Platform administrators can use Otomi Console to enable and configure platform capabilities and onboard development teams. Developers can use Otomi Console to build images, deploy applications, expose services, configure CNAMEs, configure network policies and manage secrets. Otomi Console also provided direct and context aware access to platform capabilities like code repositories, registries, logs, metrics, traces, dashboards, etc. Next to the web based self-service, both developers and admins can start a Cloud Shell and run cli commands.

### Desired state store

When Otomi is installed, the desired state of the platform is stored in the Desired State Store (the `otomi/values` repo in the local Git repository). Changes made through the Console will be reflected in the repo.

### Golden templates catalog

The `otomi/charts` Git repo includes a set of build-in Helm charts that are used to create workloads in the Console. You can also add your own charts and offer them to the users of the platform.

### Control plane

All changes made through the Console are validated by the control plane (`otomi-api`) and then committed in the state store. This will automatically trigger the platform to synchronize the desired state to the actual state of the platform.

### Automation

The automation is used to synchronize desired state with the state of applications like Keycloak, Harbor and Gitea.

### Capabilities

The platform offers a set of Kubernetes applications for all the required capabilities. Core applications are always installed, optional applications can be activated. When an application is activated, the application will be installed based on default configuration. Default configuration can be adjusted using the Console.

**Core Applications (that are always installed):**

- [Istio](https://github.com/istio/istio): The service mesh framework with end-to-end transit encryption
- [Keycloak](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak): Identity and access management for modern applications and services
