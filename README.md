## Otomi helps

**Developers** - With easy self-service to let them focus on their apps only

- Build OCI compliant images from application code
- Deploy containerized workloads the GitOps way using build-in or custom golden path templates
- Automatically update container images of workloads
- Publicly expose applications
- Get instant access to logs, metrics and traces
- Store charts and images in a private registry
- Configure network policies, response headers and CNAMEs
- Manage secrets
- Create private Git repositories and custom pipelines

**Platform engineers** - To setup a Kubernetes-based platform and provide a paved road to production

- Create your platform profile and deploy to any K8s
- Onboard development teams in a comprehensive multi-tenant setup and make them self-serving
- Get all the required capabilities in an integrated and automated way
- Ensure governance with security policies
- Implement zero-trust networking
- Change the desired state of the platform based on Configuration-as-Code
- Support multi- and hybrid cloud scenarios
- Prevent cloud provider lock-in
- Implement full observability

## Getting started

### Helm

To install Otomi, make sure to have a K8s cluster running with at least:

- Version `1.25`, `1.26` or `1.27`
- A node pool with at least **8 vCPU** and **16GB+ RAM** (more resources might be required based on the activated capabilities)
- Calico CNI installed (or any other CNI that supports K8s network policies)
- A default storage class configured
- When using the `custom` provider, make sure the K8s LoadBalancer Service created by `Otomi` can obtain an external IP (using a cloud load balancer or MetalLB)

> **_NOTE:_**  Install Otomi with DNS to unlock it's full potential. Check [otomi.io](https://otomi.io) for more info.

Add the Helm repository:

```bash
helm repo add otomi https://otomi.io/otomi-core
helm repo update
```

and then install the Helm chart:

```bash
helm install otomi otomi/otomi \
--set cluster.name=$CLUSTERNAME \
--set cluster.provider=$PROVIDER # use 'azure', 'aws', 'google', 'digitalocean', 'ovh', 'vultr', 'scaleway' or 'custom' for any other cloud or onprem K8s
```

When the installer job is completed, follow the [activation steps](https://otomi.io/docs/get-started/activation).
