# Otomi Core

Heart of the Otomi Container Platform, an opinionated stack of kubernetes apps working in tandem. It offers an out of the box operations stack to utilize kubernetes clusters.
Important features:

- **Single Sign On**: Bring your own IDP or use Keycloak
- **Multi Tenancy**: Create admins and teams to allow self service of deployments
- **Automatic Ingress Configuration**: Easily configure ingress for team services or core apps, allowing access within minutes.
- **Automatic Vulnerability Scanning**: All configured team service containers get scanned in Harbor.
- and many more (for a full list see [redkubes.com](https://redkubes.com))

This repo is also built as an image and published on [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/otomi/core) at `otomi/core`.
Other parts of the platform:

- [Otomi Tasks](https://github.com/redkubes/otomi-tasks): tasks used by core to glue all it's pieces together
- [Otomi Clients](https://github.com/redkubes/otomi-clients): clients used by the tasks, generated from vendors' openapi specs

This readme is aimed at development. If you wish to contribute please read our Developers [Contributor Code of Conduct](./docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [Contribution Guidelines](./docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).

To get up and running with the platform please follow the [online documentation for Otomi Container Platform](https://redkubes.github.io/otomi/). It lists all the prerequisites and tooling expected, so please read up before continuing here.

## Development

Most of the code is in go templates: helmfile's `*.gotmpl` and helm chart's `templates/*.yaml`. Please become familiar with it's intricacies by reading our [special section on go templating](./docs/GO_TEMPLATING.md).

For the next steps please target your values repo and cluster, and source the aliases:

```bash
# assuming you followed the previous steps and created otomi-values repo next to this:
export ENV_DIR=$PWD/../otomi-values CLOUD=google CLUSTER=demo
. bin/aliases
```

### 1. Validating changes

You can check whether resulting manifests violate any of our output checks:

```bash
otomi validate-templates
```

This will check whether any CRs are matching their CRDs, but also check for k8s manifest best practices using [kubeval](https://www.kubeval.com).

We are also integrating another solution based on [conftest](https://www.conftest.dev). It allows to create OPA policies that are used both for statical analysis (at build time), as well as by [gatekeeper](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper) (at run time) to check whether manifests are conformant.

There is in-built meta-schema validation for editing `otomi-values`-files. Refer to [meta-schema documentation](./docs/meta-schema-validation.md).

### 2. Diffing changes

To test changes in code against running clusters you will need to export at least `ENV_DIR`, `CLOUD` and `CLUSTER` and source the aliases:

After changing code you can do a diff to see everything still works and what has changed in the output manifests:

```bash
otomi diff
# or target one release:
otomi diff -l name=prometheus-operator
```

### 3. Deploying changes

It is preferred that deployment is done from the values repo, as it is tied to the clusters listed there only, and thus has a smaller blast radius.
When you feel that you are in control and want fast iteration you can connect to a values repo directly by exporting `ENV_DIR`. It is mandatory and won't work without it. The CLI will also check that you are targeting `kubectl`'s `current-context` as a failsafe mechanism.

To deploy everything in the stack:

```bash
# target your cluster
export CLOUD=google && CLUSTER=demo
# and deploy
otomi deploy
```

NOTICE: when on GKE this may sometimes result in an access token refresh error as the full path to the `gcloud` binary is referenced from GKE's token refresh mechanism in `.kube/config`, which is mounted from the host, but inaccessible from within the container. (See bug report: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/171493249).
Retrying the command usuall works, so do that to work around it for now.

It is also possible to target individual helmfile releases from the stack:

```bash
otomi apply -l name=prometheus-operator
```

This will first do a `diff` and then a `sync`. But if you expect the helm bookkeeping to not match the current state (because resources were manipulated without helm), then do a sync:

```bash
# or:
otomi sync -l name=prometheus-operator
```
