## Otomi helps 

**Developers** - To focus on their apps only
* Easy deployment of containerized workloads
* Direct access to logs and metrics
* Store charts and images in a private registry
* Build and run custom CI pipelines
* Enable declarative end-to-end workload lifecycle management
* Easy ingress and network policy configuration
* Manage your own secrets

**Platform teams** - To setup and manage production-ready Kubernetes-based platforms
* Onboard development teams in a comprehensive multi-tenant setup
* Get all the required K8s tools in an integrated way
* Create your platform profile and deploy to any K8s
* One schema to manage all platform configuration
* Ensure governance with security policies
* Implement zero-trust networking
* Make development teams self-serving
* Change the desired state of the platform based on Configuration-as-Code
* Support multi and hybrid cloud scenarios

## Getting started

### Helm

To install Otomi using Helm, make sure to have a K8s cluster running with at least:

- Version `1.22` up to `1.24`
- A node pool with **6 vCPU** and **8GB+ RAM** (more is advised!)
- Calico CNI installed (or any other CNI that supports K8s network policies)
- When installing using the `custom` provider, make sure the K8s LoadBalancer Service created by `Otomi` can obtain an external accessible IP (using a cloud load balancer or MetalLB)

Add the Helm repository:

```bash
helm repo add otomi https://otomi.io/otomi-core
helm repo update
```

and then install the Helm chart:

```bash
helm install otomi otomi/otomi \
--set cluster.k8sVersion=$VERSION \ # 1.22, 1.23 and 1.24 are supported
--set cluster.name=$CLUSTERNAME \
--set cluster.provider=$PROVIDER # use 'azure', 'aws', 'google', 'digitalocean', 'ovh', 'vultr', or 'custom' for any other cloud or onprem K8s
```

When the installer job is completed, follow the [activation steps](https://otomi.io/docs/get-started/activation).
