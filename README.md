## About Otomi

**Otomi** is a complete stack of integrated Kubernetes applications, combined with automation and self-service. Otomi can be installed with one command on any Kubernetes cluster, offering a complete platform experience out-of-the-box. No more re-inventing the wheel when building and maintaining your own Kubernetes based platform.

## Otomi helps 

1 . **Developers** - To focus on their apps only
* Deploy containerized apps with a few click without writing any K8s YAML manifests
* Get access to logs and metrics of deployed apps
* Store charts and images in a private registry
* Build and run custom CI pipelines
* Enable declarative end-to-end app lifecycle management
* Configure ingress for apps with a single click
* Manage your own secrets

2. **Platform & Operations teams** - To setup and manage production-ready Kubernetes-based platforms
* Onboard development teams on shared clusters in a comprehensive multi-tenant setup
* Get all the required observability tools in an integrated way
* Ensure governance with security policies
* Implement zero-trust networking with east-west and north-south network controll within K8s
* Provide self-service features to development teams
* Change the desired state of the platform based on configuration-as-code

3. **DevOps teams** - To take full controll and responsibility over the complete stack
* Get all the tools needed to build, deploy and run apps on K8s


## Getting started

### Helm

To install Otomi using Helm, make sure to have a K8s cluster running with at least:

- Version `1.18` up to `1.23`
- A node pool with **6 vCPU** and **8GB+ RAM** (more is advised!)
- Calico CNI installed (or any other CNI that supports K8s network policies)
- When installing using the `custom` provider, make sure the K8s LoadBalancer Service created by `Otomi` can obtain an external accessible IP (using a cloud load balancer or MetalLB)

Add the Helm repository:

```bash
helm repo add otomi https://otomi.io/otomi-core \
helm repo update
```

and then install the Helm chart:

```bash
helm install otomi otomi/otomi \
--set cluster.k8sVersion=$VERSION \ # 1.19, 1.20, 1.21, 1.22 and 1.23 are supported
--set cluster.name=$CLUSTERNAME \
--set cluster.provider=$PROVIDER # use 'azure', 'aws', 'google', 'digitalocean', 'ovh', 'vultr', or 'custom' for any other cloud or onprem K8s
```

When the installer job is completed, follow the [activation steps](https://otomi.io/docs/installation/activation/).

### K8s quick starts

Use the [quickstarts](https://github.com/redkubes/quickstart) for Azure, GCP, AWS, Linode, Digital Ocean and Minikube to provision a Kubernetes cluster. Then use the helm chart to install Otomi.

### Workshops

Use the [workshops](https://github.com/redkubes/workshops) repository, to go trough a comprehensive set of hands-on labs to get a good understanding/overview of everything Otomi has to offer.
